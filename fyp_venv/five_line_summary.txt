UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, "Ambassador Churkin was a uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit, and a man of many talents and interests."
Members of the UN Security Council said they were "deeply saddened" to learn of Churkin's death.
Churkin spent more than 40 years at the Russian Diplomatic Service and headed the Russian Mission to the United Nations for more than a decade, the Security Council said.
Churkin was known as a confident, combative, disarming and humorous fixture at the UN Security Council.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said "the outstanding Russian diplomat died while he was in his current working role."

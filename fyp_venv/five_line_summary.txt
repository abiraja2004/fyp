Members of the UN General Assembly stood for a moment of silence in memory of their colleague.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, "Ambassador Churkin was a uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit, and a man of many talents and interests."
Churkin spent more than 40 years at the Russian Diplomatic Service and headed the Russian Mission to the United Nations for more than a decade, the Security Council said.
"Devastated by passing of UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin," Power tweeted.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said, "The outstanding Russian diplomat died while he was in his current working role."

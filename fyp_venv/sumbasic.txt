"We've lost one of the most respected and influential members of the UN family," UN General Assembly President Peter Thomson said.

Churkin spent more than 40 years at the Russian Diplomatic Service and headed the Russian Mission to the United Nations for more than a decade, the Security Council said.

China would often take its cue from how Russia would vote.

He stood firm in supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime against Western attacks.

"We did not always see things the same way, but he unquestionably advocated his country's positions with great skill," she said in a statement.

"Devastated by passing of UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin," Power tweeted.

"Diplomatic maestro & deeply caring man who did all he (could) to bridge US-RUS differences."

Churkin died one day before his 65th birthday.

But authorities are waiting for reports from the New York City medical examiner's office before releasing the official cause of death.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said, "The outstanding Russian diplomat died while he was in his current working role."

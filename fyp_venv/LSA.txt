"We've lost one of the most respected and influential members of the UN family," UN General Assembly President Peter Thomson said.

Thomson said Churkin will be remembered for "his great intellect and his consummate diplomatic skills, and for his good humor and consideration for others."

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, "Ambassador Churkin was a uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit, and a man of many talents and interests."

For a decade, it was Churkin who raised his arm to veto numerous resolutions ranging from the Syrian crisis to the Malaysia Airlines crash over eastern Ukraine .

And he cited US policy in Libya as a symbol of failure by Western countries who favored regime change.

The diplomat suffered from cardiac arrest while at the Russian Mission on East 67th Street, a law enforcement official said.

Preliminary information suggests there was no foul play in Churkin's death, New York police Lt. Thomas Antonetti said.

But authorities are waiting for reports from the New York City medical examiner's office before releasing the official cause of death.

And President Vladimir Putin "expressed sympathy to the friends and family as well as to the staff of the Russian Foreign Ministry," the Kremlin said.

Thomson said Churkin will be remembered for "his great intellect and his consummate diplomatic skills, and for his good humor and consideration for others."

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, "Ambassador Churkin was a uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit, and a man of many talents and interests."

Members of the Security Council said they were "deeply saddened" to learn of Churkin's death.

Churkin spent more than 40 years at the Russian Diplomatic Service and headed the Russian Mission to the United Nations for more than a decade, the Security Council said.

Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the United Nations, called Churkin "a gracious colleague."

Susan Rice, a former US envoy to the United Nations, said Churkin was "a formidable adversary, but always a friend."

Another former US ambassador, Samantha Power, said she was heartbroken by Churkin's death and credited him with trying to help improve Russian-US relations.

"Devastated by passing of UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin," Power tweeted.

And Gérard Araud, a former French ambassador to the United Nations, said Churkin was an "extraordinary colleague" during Araud's five years on the Security Council.

Churkin died one day before his 65th birthday.

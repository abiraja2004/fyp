"We've lost one of the most respected and influential members of the UN family," said UN General Assembly President Peter Thomson.

Thomson added: "Not only has Russia lost one of its truest sons, but here at the United Nations, we've lost one of our truest."

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, "Ambassador Churkin was a uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit, and a man of many talents and interests."

Members of the UN Security Council said they were "deeply saddened" to learn of Churkin's death.

Churkin spent more than 40 years at the Russian Diplomatic Service and headed the Russian Mission to the United Nations for more than a decade, the Security Council said.

Churkin was known as a confident, combative, disarming and humorous fixture at the UN Security Council.

"Devastated by passing of UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin," Power tweeted.

And Gérard Araud, a former French ambassador to the United Nations, said Churkin was an "extraordinary colleague" during Araud's five years on the UN Security Council.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said "the outstanding Russian diplomat died while he was in his current working role."

Members of the UN General Assembly stood for a moment of silence in memory of their colleague.

"We've lost one of the most respected and influential members of the UN family," said UN General Assembly President Peter Thomson.

Thomson said Churkin will be remembered for "his great intellect and his consummate diplomatic skills, and for his good humor and consideration for others."

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, "Ambassador Churkin was a uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit, and a man of many talents and interests."

For a decade, it was Churkin who raised his arm to veto numerous resolutions ranging from the Syrian crisis to the Malaysia Airlines crash over eastern Ukraine .

He stood firm in supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime against Western attacks.

And he cited US policy in Libya as a symbol of failure by Western countries who favored regime change.

US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called Churkin "a gracious colleague."

The diplomat suffered from cardiac arrest while at the Russian Mission on East 67th Street, a law enforcement official said.

And President Vladimir Putin "expressed sympathy to the friends and family as well as to the staff of the Russian Foreign Ministry," the Kremlin said.

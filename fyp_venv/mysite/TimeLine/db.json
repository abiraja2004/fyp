Trump said on Wednesday that his transition was not in disarray, assailing news media reports about firings and infighting and insisting in an early-morning Twitter burst that everything was going \u201cso smoothly.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the process of picking cabinet members continued to be volatile, as people who were described as leading contenders earlier in the week were said to be less likely to be nominated now. And the failure to take the basic organizational steps to begin the formal transition blocked the official handoff of critical information from 100 federal agencies.\r\n\r\nRudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, had been a leading candidate to be secretary of state. But people familiar with the latest discussions and one person who has spoken directly with Mr. Trump said the president-elect had growing reservations about Mr. Giuliani, who for 48 hours eagerly stoked news of his possible appointment.\r\n\r\nDisclosures from Mr. Trump\u2019s office in Trump Tower in Manhattan continued throughout the day. Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio host and author, could join the Trump administration, according to two people who have spoken to the transition team. Ms. Ingraham, a fiery critic of the news media who worked on domestic policy for the Reagan White House, has told Trump aides that she would be interested in a number of posts.\r\n\r\nLate Wednesday, reports surfaced that Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who backed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican primaries, might now be a candidate for secretary of state.\r\n\r\nIn a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump kicked off a concerted effort to reshape the narrative of a chaotic transition that has taken hold in the week since he won the election. In several conversations with reporters, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides said that their efforts to assemble a new government were not in turmoil.\r\n\r\nThe president-elect criticized, and misrepresented, a report in The New York Times that said Mr. Trump had taken calls from several world leaders, but had done so haphazardly and without the normal State Department briefings that traditionally guide conversations with foreign leaders.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump wrote that he had received \u201ccalls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said.\u201d Of the transition effort, Mr. Trump added in another post, \u201cIt is going so smoothly.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the transition\u2019s first conference call with reporters on Wednesday night, aides to Mr. Trump said teams would be announced on Thursday to begin the formal handoff from the State, Justice and Defense Departments and the National Security Council.\r\n\r\nSean Spicer, an adviser to Mr. Trump, said that the president-elect would also meet on Thursday with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Ms. Haley and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, among others as he builds his administration.\r\n\r\nAdvisers to Mr. Trump said that reports of chaos were being spread by disgruntled former members of the transition or people bitter about the election results. Representative Devin Nunes of California, who is a member of the executive committee advising Mr. Trump and is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the transition was actually operating more efficiently because it was not filled with Washington elitists.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe only people who are in chaos are the press,\u201d Mr. Nunes said.\r\n\r\nAides to Mr. Trump acknowledged that members of the transition team had been fired since the ouster of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as the head of the transition. But they denied that the firings were the result of a purge of Mr. Christie\u2019s allies orchestrated by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law. \u201cCompletely inaccurate,\u201d said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump.\r\n\r\nInstead, they said that the housecleaning was part of a renewed effort by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the new transition chief, to eliminate lobbyists from the transition team. They declined to provide details about how many lobbyists had been fired or to name them, but said it was a priority.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we talk about draining the swamp, this is one of the first steps,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump has been ensconced in Trump Tower for days as he deliberates. A steady stream of potential nominees and transition officials arrived for meetings on Wednesday as the team released a list of 29 foreign leaders he and Mr. Pence had spoken with in recent days.\r\n\r\nThe lobby of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition headquarters a block from the White House in Washington appeared to be bustling, with national security, transportation and other policy advisers arriving for meetings.\r\n\r\nBut progress has been slow toward transferring control of the federal work force of 2.8 million people. A White House official said that administration officials at government agencies remained legally barred from delivering the guidance and briefings to Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team because essential documents had still not been completed.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale shake-up of Mr. Trump\u2019s team, including Mr. Christie\u2019s ouster, forced Mr. Pence to sign new documents required by law. White House officials said Mr. Pence delivered them on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nBut by Wednesday night, Mr. Trump\u2019s team still had not delivered a series of required supporting documents, including certifications that each transition member would abide by a code of conduct and would not divulge sensitive information about the inner workings of the government.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe next step is for the president-elect\u2019s transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government,\u201d said Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for the White House. \u201cOnce we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lack of progress fit with Mr. Trump\u2019s image during his presidential campaign as a professed disrupter of the status quo in Washington, disdainful of the institutions of government and reluctant to submit to the protocols and traditions that fuel so much of what happens here.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump was not the first president-elect to preside over a disorderly transition. George Bush\u2019s transition in 1988 was marked by Republican infighting after many of Ronald Reagan\u2019s aides were denied jobs in the new administration. Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 transition was marred by a personnel shake-up and a difficult-to-accomplish campaign promise he had made to slash the White House staff by a quarter. George W. Bush had a late start because of the disputed 2000 election result, and Barack Obama had to replace his head of personnel several times. But veterans of Washington\u2019s transition rituals said Mr. Trump seemed to be further behind.\r\n\r\nOfficials in Mr. Obama\u2019s administration said on Wednesday that they were ready to engage with Mr. Trump\u2019s team. But they said little contact had been made. At the State Department, officials said that no one from the transition office had requested briefings ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting on Thursday with Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe stand ready to support him and his team with any information that they might require,\u201d said John Kirby, the State Department spokesman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been no outreach to date,\u201d Mr. Kirby added.", "fivelinesummary": "In the transition\u2019s first conference call with reporters on Wednesday night, aides to Mr. Trump said teams would be announced on Thursday to begin the formal handoff from the State, Justice and Defense Departments and the National Security Council.\r\nSean Spicer, an adviser to Mr. Trump, said that the president-elect would also meet on Thursday with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Ms. Haley and Adm.

Officials from the White House and 100 federal agencies are on standby, waiting to meet \u201clanding teams\u201d from the president-elect\u2019s staff and brief them on how things really work in government. The organizational charts have been meticulously mapped.\r\n\r\nBut eight days after President-elect Donald J. Trump won election in a stunning upset, surprising even himself, the process of transferring power from the Obama administration to the Trump administration has yet to grind into motion, delayed by a series of shake-ups at Trump Tower that have sown confusion and discord. One associate of Mr. Trump\u2019s has told people that his operation is a month behind schedule.\r\n\r\nUnder ideal circumstances, the process \u2014 months in the planning by the Obama administration and aides to both Mr. Trump and his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton \u2014 looks far different. Parts of it are governed by a statute President Obama signed this year to streamline the transition process and ensure an early start to a task that has been compared to a giant corporate merger involving a $4 trillion budget.\r\n\r\nBut for all the drama surrounding his transition to power, Mr. Trump is hardly the first president-elect to preside over a disorderly takeover.\r\n\r\nThe 1988 transition from Ronald Reagan to George Bush was particularly nasty, because many Reagan administration aides assumed \u2014 wrongly, as it turned out \u2014 that they would be in line to keep their jobs in a government that remained in Republican hands.\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nBill Clinton\u2019s transition in 1992 was marred by a staff shake-up that upended a carefully planned process: Mr. Clinton replaced his transition chief, Mickey Kantor, who had been Mr. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, with Warren Christopher, who would become secretary of state. It was also hobbled by Mr. Clinton\u2019s campaign promise to slash White House staff by 25 percent, which made it more difficult to manage the government.\r\n\r\nAnd even in the 2008-9 transition from George W. Bush to Mr. Obama that members of both parties consider a model of efficiency, Mr. Obama had to replace his head of personnel several times.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a long history of unfortunate transition activity,\u201d said Max Stier, the president and chief executive of the Center for Presidential Transition, a project run by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.\r\n\r\nStill, he added, the Trump transition is different in that it appears to lack guidance from seasoned government professionals who grasp the magnitude of the bureaucracy he is about to inherit.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a president-elect who has been elected on a platform of change from the outside,\u201d Mr. Stier said. \u201cThis is distinctive in that there is not anybody in the inner orbit who has deep understanding of the institution that Trump is going to have to run.\u201d\r\n\r\nSetting the ground rules\r\n\r\nA memorandum of understanding between the White House chief of staff and the leader of the president-elect\u2019s transition team is typically signed by both immediately after the election, as was the case when Mr. Obama was preparing to take office. The document governs the terms by which the president\u2019s staff and that of the president-elect collaborate, including important nondisclosure requirements for both sides, and its completion unlocks the rest of the transition process.\r\n\r\nGov. Chris Christie of New Jersey signed such an agreement on Nov. 8, before the election result was determined, but it was invalidated on Friday when Mr. Trump turned over the transition operation to Vice President-elect Mike Pence. A transition spokesman said late Tuesday that Mr. Pence had signed the document. But Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman, said the transition team had not yet provided the list of officials who would be participating in the process, a requirement before the handover can begin.\r\n\r\nLanding teams arrive\r\n\r\nWithin a few days of the election, the landing teams are supposed to begin work at federal offices to learn about their inner workings, functions and responsibilities; to determine how to staff crucial positions there; and to figure out how they fit in with the new administration\u2019s goals and priorities. They receive briefings about the pressing issues facing the agencies and immediate tasks that the president-elect must undertake on Day 1.\r\n\r\nThis crucial time period in November is when the incoming president\u2019s team typically devises plans for carrying out top policy priorities and develops a budget proposal that will be presented early the next year, defining the administration\u2019s goals and laying out a pathway for achieving them.\r\n\r\nAs of Wednesday evening, nobody from Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team had arrived at a federal agency to begin the review process, according to Obama administration officials.\r\n\r\nPersonnel is policy\r\n\r\nThe transition team typically works quickly, based on plans put in place months before, to recruit, vet and hire the 4,000 presidential appointees needed to run the government, including about 1,000 who will require Senate confirmation. Presidential candidates typically pre-vet hundreds of potential appointees well before the election, cognizant of how quickly they must move once elected to build out their teams.\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration, which found the process cumbersome and the government\u2019s mechanisms for managing it outdated in 2008, has built a new software system for the president-elect to track candidates for the appointments and process those selected.\r\n\r\nAccording to the independent, nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition, a project of the Partnership for Public Service, the president-elect should aim to select 50 top cabinet appointees and key White House personnel before Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nPreparing for the worst\r\n\r\nSince the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, national security preparedness has taken on outsized importance in transition planning. In January 2009, the week before Mr. Obama was inaugurated, the Bush administration held a war-game exercise in the White House Situation Room, simulating a series of explosions in American cities so that current national security officials could guide incoming aides on how to respond to such an attack.\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration is planning two such exercises for Mr. Trump\u2019s team, one in December and one in January.

Situation Room, simulating a series of explosions in American cities so that current national security officials could guide incoming aides on how to respond to such an attack.\r\nAs of Tuesday, Mr.

Executive Council, Ms. Warren, who sparred in viciously personal terms with Mr. Trump during the campaign, noted the many ways she agreed with the president-elect.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe spoke of the need to reform our trade deals so they aren\u2019t raw deals for the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said he will not cut Social Security benefits. He talked about the need to address the rising cost of college and about helping working parents struggling with the high cost of child care. He spoke of the urgency of rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and putting people back to work. He spoke to the very real sense of millions of Americans that their government and their economy has abandoned them. And he promised to rebuild our economy for working people.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, long a critic of trade deals, said in an interview that he had spoken extensively with Mr. Trump\u2019s trade adviser and would work with him on issues concerning steel workers. \u201cWe can work with him on things we agree on,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cOn Bannon, no.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Brown sent a letter to Mr. Trump urging him to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, make changes to the trade relationship with China and fight currency manipulation, which is also a pet issue of Mr. Schumer. Mr. Sanders put out a statement after the election saying he too would work with Mr. Trump on areas of populist agreement.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, they remain his adversary on other matters.

The prosecutor, J. Gerald Hebert, said he had heard a shocking story: A federal judge had called a prominent white lawyer \u201ca disgrace to his race\u201d for representing black clients.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Sessions replied, according to Mr. Hebert, \u201cmaybe he is.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn testimony before Congress in 1986, Mr. Hebert and others painted an unflattering portrait of Mr. Sessions, who would go on to become a senator from Alabama and now, according to numerous sources close to President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s transition team, is a potential nominee for attorney general or secretary of defense. Mr. Hebert testified that Mr. Sessions had referred to the American Civil Liberties Union and the N.A.A.C.P. as \u201cun-American\u201d for \u201ctrying to force civil rights down the throats of people.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne African-American prosecutor testified that Mr. Sessions had called him \u201cboy\u201d and joked that he thought that the Ku Klux Klan \u201cwas O.K. until I found out they smoked pot.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Sessions denied calling the lawyer \u201cboy\u201d but acknowledged or did not dispute the substance of the other remarks. The bitter testimony sank his nomination by President Ronald Reagan to be a federal district court judge and foreshadowed the questions that Mr. Sessions could face at another set of Senate confirmation hearings if Mr. Trump nominates him for a cabinet position.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly 20 years in the Senate, Mr. Sessions, 69, now has more allies and would face a clearer road to confirmation than he did as a young judicial nominee. And as the first senator to endorse Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, he has a special status as an early supporter who became an important surrogate and close adviser.\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nBut for Mr. Trump a Sessions nomination to a critical position at the Justice or Defense Department still presents risks. Mr. Trump faced criticism over his derogatory remarks about Mexicans and his support from racist groups throughout his campaign, and for his appointment of a nationalist media executive to a top White House position since his election. A Sessions nomination raises the possibility that a Trump administration will open with racially charged hearings.\r\n\r\nA spokesman for Mr. Sessions did not respond to a request for comment. But on Tuesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Sessions for a major job in the Trump administration.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think Jeff Sessions has earned the right to serve Donald Trump in the highest levels,\u201d he told reporters.\r\n\r\nAs attorney general, Mr. Sessions would be responsible for upholding civil rights laws. As secretary of defense, he would oversee one of the most ethnically diverse institutions in the country; 25 percent of the military is African-American, Asian or Hispanic.\r\n\r\nAs one of the most conservative members of the Senate, Mr. Sessions has been a reliable voice for strict immigration enforcement, reduced spending and tough-on-crime measures. He is generally well liked among colleagues in both parties, and took a political risk endorsing Mr. Trump shortly after the South Carolina primary. His views on immigration and trade are aligned with the message that Mr. Trump conveyed during the race. Mr. Sessions has frequently traveled with Mr. Trump and was said at one point to be under consideration as the vice-presidential nominee.\r\n\r\nMr. Sessions has long considered it a personal triumph that he was elected to the Senate and became a member of the Judiciary Committee after that same panel rejected his nomination to the bench. Two Republicans joined Democrats in opposing his nomination. One of those Republicans, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, later said his vote had been a mistake \u2014 a fact that Mr. Sessions likes to point out.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Sessions\u2019 1986 hearings were unusually rancorous, both for the era and for the position he was seeking. The sessions stretched for hours as Justice Department officials were called to testify about their colleague\u2019s views on race. Mr. Sessions said his comment about the Klan was meant as a joke and said it was so preposterous \u2014 especially since he was in the middle of prosecuting a case involving the group \u2014 that he thought nobody could take it seriously.\r\n\r\nHe was less clear about his remarks about civil rights groups. Asked whether he ever said the N.A.A.C.P. hates white people or was \u201ca commie group and a pinko organization,\u201d Mr. Sessions said he could not recall specifically saying that. \u201cI am loose with my tongue on occasion, and I may have said something similar to that or could be interpreted to that,\u201d he testified.\r\n\r\nHe went on to praise the N.A.A.C.P. for its work for racial equality in the South. He said he never called the group or the A.C.L.U. un-American, but added: \u201cI said that they take positions that are considered un-American. They hurt themselves; they lose credibility. And many people do think that some of those positions they take are against the national interests of the United States.\u201d He said he was referring to liberal immigration policies and support for the socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nAt the Justice Department today, lawyers regard N.A.A.C.P. officials as partners in the fight for equal rights. \u201cLaws alone do not guarantee justice, eradicate hate or advance freedom,\u201d Vanita Gupta, the Obama administration\u2019s top civil rights prosecutor, told the group in July. \u201cPeople do. People like you do. Organizations like the N.A.A.C.P. do.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe N.A.A.C.P. also played a key role in fighting to integrate the military. The percentage of African-Americans in the military \u2014 now 17 percent \u2014 has grown steadily since President Harry S. Truman signed an order in 1948 that ended segregation in the armed forces.\r\n\r\nMr. Sessions also did not dispute Mr. Hebert\u2019s recollection of their conversation about the white lawyer. He said he remembered the conversation, but not precisely what he said. \u201cI guess I will not disagree with him,\u201d Mr. Sessions testified, \u201cand I do not know why \u2014 I cannot imagine why I would make that comment.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn African-American prosecutor, Thomas H. Figures, testified that Mr. Sessions referred to him as \u201cboy.\u201d Once, after an argument with a secretary, \u201cMr. Sessions admonished me to \u2018be careful what you say to white folks,\u2019\u201d Mr. Figures testified. Mr. Sessions denied saying that and was adamant that he had never called Mr. Figures \u201cboy.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Sessions had his supporters, including an Alabama judge, Ferrill D. McRae. \u201cI have watched this young man since he started practicing law in Mobile,\u201d Judge McRae wrote. \u201cHe is honest, hard-working, fair and compassionate for all his fellow man.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a phone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Hebert said it was a \u201cfrightening thought\u201d that Mr. Sessions might lead the Justice Department. As for the Pentagon, he said, \u201cHis racial insensitivity might not be as manifest in such a position, but I wouldn\u2019t feel good about it if I were a black soldier.\u201d", "fivelinesummary": "The prosecutor, J.

Trump had requested a top-secret security clearance for his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, people close to Mr. Kushner said that was not the case. No such request has been made, they said on Wednesday, and he will not sit in on the president\u2019s highly classified daily intelligence briefing.\r\n\r\nBut should Mr. Trump change his mind, former government officials and experts on classified information said he would have wide latitude as president to bring a family member into the most secret circles of the government.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe president can authorize clearance for anyone he wants,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, director of the project on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. \u201cIt\u2019s part of his commander-in-chief role. He has broad, essentially unlimited, access in this area.\u201d\r\n\r\nLike anyone else, Mr. Kushner would be subject to a background check by the F.B.I. But the president\u2019s authority is so broad, Mr. Aftergood said, that he could override red flags \u2014 like fraud, huge personal debt or ties to foreign governments \u2014 that would disqualify other applicants.\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nMr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Wednesday that he was not seeking security clearances for his children, who he has said will run his businesses while he is in the White House. But he did not address the case of Mr. Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s elder daughter, Ivanka.\r\n\r\nAn anti-nepotism law passed by Congress after President John F. Kennedy appointed his brother Robert as attorney general in 1961 would make it difficult, if not impossible, for Mr. Kushner to take a senior position in the Trump administration, according to legal experts. But they said there was no prohibition on Mr. Kushner\u2019s serving as an unpaid adviser to the president.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Trump wanted to make the arrangement more formal, he could name Mr. Kushner to the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board, a 16-member committee that advises the president on intelligence matters and investigates the legality of intelligence operations. Members of the board, which dates back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, include former diplomats, military officers and other government officials.\r\n\r\nAmong its current members are Mich\u00e8le A. Flournoy, a former under secretary of defense who was considered the front-runner to serve as defense secretary if Hillary Clinton had won the election; Wendy R. Sherman, a former under secretary of state who helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal; and Gen. John Abizaid, a top commander during the Iraq war.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know of no limitations on the president\u2019s ability to consult private citizens about sensitive national security issues,\u201d said Gregory B. Craig, a former White House counsel to President Obama. With the advisory board, he said, \u201cit happens in a more structured and formal sense.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Craig noted that private citizens are routinely given clearances to handle national-security assignments, like the Manhattan Project, or legal cases that involve classified material, as with David E. Kendall, the lawyer who represented Gen. David H. Petraeus when he was charged with turning over his confidential diary to his biographer and mistress.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Trump were to take any of these steps with Mr. Kushner, however, he would be breaking with decades of practice. Normally, a security clearance is granted because a person\u2019s job requires access to classified information, or because of a specific assignment that involves secrets. Members of a president\u2019s family do not receive clearances, even though the president may discuss sensitive topics in their presence.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no justification for top-secret security clearances for members of the president\u2019s family,\u201d said Richard W. Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, who now teaches at the University of Minnesota Law School. \u201cI don\u2019t remember Laura Bush or Hillary Clinton having a top-secret clearance.\u201d\r\n\r\nKellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, brushed aside questions from reporters on Wednesday about whether it was a conflict of interest for Mr. Trump\u2019s children to play a role in his transition when they were running his businesses.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re presuming that they\u2019re doing certain things that they should not be doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re his children, and they\u2019ve been his business colleagues for a very long time. They obviously support their father as president.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Kushner already occupies a singular position in his father-in-law\u2019s orbit. He was at Mr. Trump\u2019s side during much of his campaign and has taken a strong behind-the-scenes role in the transition. He was behind the recent shake-ups that removed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, former Representative Mike Rogers and others from the transition team.\r\n\r\nIf he took part in the daily briefing, Mr. Kushner would join one of the most rarefied circles in Washington. During Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, the only people regularly in the room, besides Mr. Obama, have been the vice president, the chief of staff, the national security adviser, the national security adviser\u2019s deputy, the vice president\u2019s national security adviser and the counterterrorism adviser. All hold the highest-level clearance, issued by the director of national intelligence: Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information.\r\n\r\nMr. Obama\u2019s closest political advisers, Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod, were never in the room.

Trump doesn\u2019t want them to get too comfortable.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren\u2019t happy about, but we\u2019re putting on term limits,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that aired on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of things to clean up the system.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf one thing could put Mr. Trump on a collision course with his new allies on Capitol Hill, it is his embrace of proposals such as term limits and tougher restrictions on allowing lawmakers and top aides to become lobbyists in the lucrative world of Washington influence peddling.\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress like to talk about returning power to the people, but many would prefer not to vote to limit their own tenure or future employment opportunities. Bringing up term limits is seen by some as raining on their postelection parade.\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nSenator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, made that quite clear last week when he said the Senate outlook for term limits was severely limited.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would say we have term limits now,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters. \u201cThey\u2019re called elections. And it will not be on the agenda in the Senate.\u201d\r\n\r\nStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s highlighting of his call for term limits \u2014 it is No. 1 on his list of priorities to \u201cclean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, D.C.\u201d \u2014 revives an initiative that has been dormant in Washington for years after Republicans rode it to the House takeover in 1994 but then failed to make it happen.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump found a surprising kindred spirit on term limits on Monday when President Obama seemed to endorse the concept.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a news conference. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nAides said later that Mr. Obama might have been referring more to the limit on presidential tenure, and his view that George Washington set the right precedent by leaving after two terms. But his words could certainly be extended to Congress.\r\n\r\nProponents of term limits say Mr. Trump\u2019s position has put new energy behind the campaign to adopt a constitutional amendment restricting House members to three two-year terms and senators to two six-year terms.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe other part of the pressure is going to come from the public,\u201d said Nick Tomboulides, the executive director of the group U.S. Term Limits. \u201cWhen they know term limits is an issue on the table, they will make it very difficult for Congress to ignore. I think Congress is going to be forced to vote on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nTerm limits have always been popular with voters and got a surge of momentum in the \u201cthrow the bums out\u201d political atmosphere of the early 1990s, leading multiple states to adopt them for their legislatures through ballot initiatives and other means.\r\n\r\nAs part of the \u201cContract With America\u201d in 1994, Republicans led by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia promised the \u201cCitizen Legislature Act\u201d and a \u201cfirst-ever vote on term limits to replace career politicians with citizen legislators.\u201d The mantra helped them topple Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington, a staunch opponent of term limits, via a challenger, George Nethercutt, who promised to serve just six years (though he later violated that pledge).\r\n\r\nThat term limits vote did come in March 1995 and won a majority but fell more than 60 votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary to advance a constitutional amendment. Forty Republicans, many of them committee and subcommittee chairmen, joined Democratic opponents in defeating the proposal. The amendment again fell short a year later.\r\n\r\nOpponents argued then, and argue now, that arbitrary term limits would rob Congress of the institutional knowledge and expertise needed to conduct business and that voters had regular opportunities to end the service of their lawmakers. They don\u2019t talk about how gerrymandering and the advantages of incumbency make it hard to defeat sitting lawmakers.\r\n\r\nWhether the proposal can go anywhere this year will depend on how serious Mr. Trump and his advisers are about pushing it against the wishes of congressional leaders, or whether it was just part of his message to stir up frustrated voters. At this point, it is impossible to say, but it was a primary element of his call to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d that appeared to resonate with the public.\r\n\r\nAnd term limits are just one issue.

Trump\u2019s effort to assemble a national security team lies the more fundamental question of how he will address the immediate and complex challenges he inherits upon taking office.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump has never articulated any detailed foreign policy vision beyond the vague slogan \u201cAmerica First.\u201d The diverse and shifting cast of potential appointees under consideration for top administration jobs has only highlighted the deep splits among conservatives about how the new administration should confront fast-evolving threats involving Iran, North Korea, Syria and Russia, among others, and how it should manage relations with allies in Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m America First,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a March interview with The New York Times, describing for the first time what the phrase meant to him. \u201cWe have been disrespected, mocked and ripped off for many, many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, from his personnel appointments to his first major meeting with a foreign leader \u2014 it came Thursday in New York, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan \u2014 Mr. Trump faces a series of decisions that will begin to flesh out his approach to the world and provide some clue as to how he might respond to whatever crises confront him as commander in chief.\r\n\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nDoes \u201cAmerica First\u201d mean he will use America\u2019s military and cyberpower pre-emptively, to wipe out emerging threats, from rogue nuclear states to terrorist groups, before they can do harm to the United States? Or does it mean he calls America\u2019s forward-deployed troops back home, building them into a defensive, retaliatory force that can lash out if the nation is attacked?\r\n\r\nAt moments during the campaign, he suggested both approaches. He said he would \u201ctake the oil\u201d from Islamic State-controlled areas of Iraq, and he criticized President Obama for pulling troops out too soon. But he is also the man who rejected nation-building and asked, \u201cWhy is it always the United States that gets right in the middle of things?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe added, \u201cAt some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo one knows what response to expect from Mr. Trump, a man who said he prided himself on following his instincts and has little patience for careful legalisms of his predecessor. But while presidents change, the challenges do not.\r\n\r\nThe Iran Nuclear Deal\r\n\r\nMr. Trump called the agreement reached with Iran in July 2015, intended to constrain Tehran from building nuclear weapons, \u201cone of the most incompetent deals of any kind I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d and he promised to fix it.\r\n\r\nBecause the Iran deal is an executive agreement, not a treaty, the new president has great latitude to alter or scrap it. But two can play that game: The Iranians are deeply unhappy with the accord, too, arguing that they never got the relief from sanctions that they were promised. Any effort to reopen the bargaining will also give Iran\u2019s mullahs, military officers and conservatives a chance to alter the pact \u2014 or threaten to resume their race for nuclear capability.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Trump, the Iran deal was not only misguided, but also badly negotiated. \u201cThey should\u2019ve walked,\u201d he said of Secretary of State John Kerry and his negotiating team. Mr. Trump said he would have left the negotiating room, doubled down on sanctions, and never agreed to give back billions of dollars, money that belonged to Iran and was frozen in American financial institutions.\r\n\r\nBut when pressed, he struggled to name any part of the deal he would have walked out of the negotiations to alter. With some prompting, he finally settled on a common critique: that after 15 years, Iran will be free to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium again, in any quantity.\r\n\r\nIn \u201cAmerica First\u201d terms, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision about what to do with the Iran deal will be an early test of his willingness to act unilaterally. The nations that joined the United States in the negotiations \u2014 Britain, France, Russia and China \u2014 not only support the deal, but are rushing to take economic advantage of it by building commercial ties with Iran. If Mr. Trump wanted to abandon the deal or reimpose sanctions, they would almost certainly refuse to go along.\r\n\r\nThe Iranians hold a few cards, too. In January they shipped 98 percent of their nuclear fuel out of the country, disabled a plutonium reactor and took thousands of centrifuges, which enrich uranium, out of service. If the deal were to be declared dead, they would be free to re-create their nuclear infrastructure and rebuild their stockpile, now frozen until 2030. By Obama administration estimates, it would take about a year for them to produce enough new material for a weapon \u2014 longer to produce the weapon itself.\r\n\r\nOne option for Mr. Trump, advocated by many Republicans, is to simply reimpose sanctions on Iran for non-nuclear reasons, including its activities in Syria and its continued support of terrorism. The Iranians would say that violates the spirit of the agreement \u2014 and Iran\u2019s leadership has already threatened that such action would nullify it.\r\n\r\nNuclear North Korea\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say which has sounded more confrontational in recent years about North Korea: the Obama administration, which has regularly warned of a \u201cdevastating response\u201d to any North Korean use of its expanding nuclear arsenal, or the Republicans, who spent much of the Bush years plotting ways to make the country\u2019s regime collapse.\r\n\r\nBut if there is likely to be an early test of Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction to provocations, North Korea is probably it. The nation has accelerated its nuclear tests, and its arsenal is growing: It could have 20 to 50 weapons during Mr. Trump\u2019s term.\r\n\r\nIn his security briefings, Mr. Trump will be hearing the latest estimates for how long it will take the North to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach America \u2014 the public figure is five years or so, though some intelligence officials believe it could happen significantly sooner.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump has at various times described North Korea\u2019s young leader, Kim Jong-un, as \u201ca maniac,\u201d even while expressing grudging admiration for Mr. Kim\u2019s toughness.\r\n\r\nSo the early \u201cAmerica First\u201d choice will be this: Should Mr. Trump confront the North with full-on sanctions, more missile defenses and perhaps a naval blockade to stop all trade that does not go across the Chinese border? Perhaps that is what Mr. Trump meant when he said that \u201cwe should use our economic power to have them disarm.\u201d\r\n\r\nShould he reopen negotiations with a nation that has made clear that its nuclear arsenal is nonnegotiable? Perhaps that is what Mr. Trump was suggesting when he said he was willing to meet one on one with Mr. Kim over a hamburger.\r\n\r\nOr, as yet another option, should he pull back American forces in the Pacific and let the Chinese and the Japanese deal with the problem? He suggested just that in a July interview with The New York Times, saying that if countries did not pay their fair share for defense, he was prepared to tell them, \u201cCongratulations, you will be defending yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Syria Conundrum\r\n\r\nMr. Trump made clear, before and after the election, that he was determined to reverse American policy in Syria, and perhaps elsewhere in the Middle East. At the core of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach is an argument that the nation\u2019s only interest in the region is to fight the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, a position vigorously endorsed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the onetime New York City mayor who was seen as a leading candidate for secretary of state.\r\n\r\nTo ramp that up, Mr. Trump argued again last week that the United States should ally itself with Russia and the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, five years after Mr. Obama declared that Mr. Assad must leave office. Mr. Assad said he was cautiously optimistic that Mr. Trump could be a \u201cnatural ally\u201d in battling terrorism.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Trump follows through on his campaign positions, it would essentially mean aligning the United States with a man now believed to have presided over the killing of more than 470,000 of his own citizens. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Assad is a good man, \u2019cause he\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Trump said in March, \u201cbut our far greater problem is not Assad, it\u2019s ISIS.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Trump changes course on Syria \u2014 and particularly on Mr. Assad \u2014 will be watched closely by other authoritarians around the world. Chief among them: President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, another strongman who is imprisoning dissenters, or worse, while seeking more American military aid, and the Saudi royal family, about whom Mr. Trump has been deeply critical.\r\n\r\nRussia and NATO\r\n\r\nThree of the leading candidates for top national security jobs in the new administration \u2014 Mr. Giuliani, John R. Bolton and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama \u2014 have all been reflexively critical of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian leader. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Mr. Sessions said Russia must feel \u201cpain for this,\u201d because if it did not, Mr. Putin could feel free to \u201cmove forward to take all of Ukraine.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Trump, in contrast, has said that in his view, the United States was more concerned about Russia\u2019s seizure of territory in Ukraine than its neighbors were. He has at times hinted that he might seek to end sanctions against Moscow.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump has also suggested that the time has come for a \u201creset\u201d of Russia policy that would essentially seek a series of partnerships with Moscow. He has never indicated how he would react if, for example, Mr. Putin tested him by seizing more territory, especially in non-NATO countries.\r\n\r\nThe debate over containing Russia or joining up with it may be one of the most crucial in the early days of a Trump presidency. European states will be looking for reassurance that Mr. Trump\u2019s talk about pulling back from NATO commitments was campaign chatter, not policy. Mr. Obama, meeting European leaders this week, is repeating the familiar reassurances about the American commitment to Europe. But his assurances will mean little, several European diplomats have noted in recent days, since he also assured his counterparts that Mr. Trump would not get elected.", "fivelinesummary": "In his security briefings, Mr. Trump will be hearing the latest estimates for how long it will take the North to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach America \u2014 the public figure is five years or so, though some intelligence officials believe it could happen significantly sooner.\r\nRussia and NATO Three of the leading candidates for top national security jobs in the new administration \u2014 Mr. Giuliani, John R.

relationship enters new era", "content": "Washington (CNN)Donald Trump will get his first shot at face-to-face diplomacy on Friday when he welcomes his first foreign visitor to the Oval Office, British Prime Minister Theresa May.\r\n\r\nThe new US president and the premier, who took office in July, both have strong political incentives to make the visit -- likely to be heavier on symbolism and aspiration than deliverables -- a roaring success.\r\nThe Prime Minister is telling Britons their country will be a robust global trading power once it has exited the European Union, and a free-trade pact with the US is the most important pillar of that plan.\r\nTrump also has an interest in talking up a trade deal. The envisioned agreement with Britain is exactly the kind of bilateral pact that the Trump administration says is the model for US trade policy going forward.\r\n\r\nWith his White House being castigated for protectionist policies, a strong commitment to work towards such a deal would allow Trump to flesh out his point that he is not against all trade -- just big multi-national pacts that he deems punitive to the United States.\r\nHowever, he previewed the visit by griping that Democrats have yet to confirm his commerce secretary pick, Wilbur Ross.\r\n\"I'm meeting with the Prime Minister tomorrow, as you know. Great Britain ... I don't have my commerce secretary -- they want to talk trade. So, I'll have to handle it myself. Which is okay,\" he told Republican lawmakers in Philadelphia on Thursday.\r\nTrump also starts the meeting from May from a position of strength, given that he is granting her the honor of being his first foreign leader visit. But his need for a successful outcome became more acute on Thursday, when a spat with Mexico over his vow to build a border wall swiftly escalated and caused the cancellation of a visit to the White House next week by President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\r\nMay is getting time in the office unusually early after a presidential inauguration.\r\nFormer President Barack Obama chose then-Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso as his first guest, a month after he was inaugurated. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was his second guest but their summit -- remembered mostly for its awkward body language and other distractions -- didn't take place until March.\r\nRELATED: British PM May: Praise for Trump -- but strong words, too\r\nThat May will be in the Oval Office exactly seven days after Trump was inaugurated is being seen by her entourage as a sign of the new President's respect for Britain.\r\nTrump has often spoken of his administration for Queen Elizabeth II, and his mother's heritage in Scotland, where he owns two renowned golf courses.\r\nAltogether, the visit offers Trump a fairly unchallenging first assignment as a world leader, though his paucity of diplomatic and political experience means his demeanor and stagecraft will still be closely watched.\r\nAnd the careful choreography of his first week -- filled with rollouts of executive orders that fulfill key campaign promises -- has often been overshadowed by his penchant for making unpredictable statements and using disputed facts.\r\nSo it's not impossible the President could go off script or commit a diplomatic faux pas in front of the British press, which is always on the lookout for any linguistic nuance casting doubt on the \"special relationship\" -- a quirk that baffled the Obama administration in its initial engagements with the British.\r\nMay plans to use the visit to stress that though Britain is leaving Europe and Trump is suspicious of US attachments abroad, the two nations can still combine to be a force that can shape the world.\r\n\"We are excited -- it speaks to the breadth and the depth of the special relationship that we are the first country to be visiting,\" a UK official told CNN.\r\nRELATED: Friendliness with Trump will give Theresa May a European headache\r\n\"As we rediscover our confidence together -- as you renew your nation just as we renew ours -- we have the opportunity, indeed the responsibility, to renew the 'special relationship' for this new age,\" May told GOP lawmakers Thursday in Philadelphia, her first US stop. \"We have the opportunity to lead, together, again.\"\r\nThe British Prime Minister will also have the benefit of the advice of former President Barack Obama, who urged her to develop a close relationship with Trump in the hope that she and other center-right world leaders could be a moderating influence on him, according to a former senior administration official and a UK official familiar with the conversations.\r\nBut while the body language may well be positive between Trump and May, they still have their share of disagreements.\r\nMay's visit will be the first test of some of Trump's most controversial views on foreign policy, ones that put him at odds with the bulk of US allies.\r\nRELATED: Obama's advice to British PM: Befriend Donald Trump\r\nTrump's statements that NATO is obsolete and that he wants to improve relations with a Russia that has been testing the borders of post-Cold War Europe have triggered alarm on the other side of the Atlantic.\r\nTrump's hostility to environmental regulations introduced by the Obama administration to comply with the international Paris climate agreement are also sparking opposition to the new White House in the UK.\r\nMay also was critical of Trump's conduct towards women following revelations about his past during the election campaign.\r\nThe no-nonsense Prime Minister is making clear that while she plans to forge a close relationship with Trump, she will not hesitate to speak her mind.\r\n\"I am not afraid to speak frankly to the President of the United States,\" May said in Parliament on Wednesday. \"I am able to do that because we have this special relationship.\"\r\nMay is likely to impress upon Trump the importance and continued vitality of NATO. Britain's calls for all members to meet their military spending target of 2% of GDP, may allow her government to become a point of liaison between states in the Western alliance and the new president, who has frequently groused that US allies have not done enough to pay for their own defense.\r\nAnd then there are their backgrounds, which provide little common ground.\r\nThe President is brash, boastful, larger than life, obsessed with his self-image and not prone to delving deeply into the details of policy.\r\nMay, a clergyman's daughter, is conservative, self-contained and renowned for poring over briefing books late at night. Her only visible flamboyance is a penchant for leopard skin kitten heels.\r\nBut while they may not be soulmates, Trump and May both find themselves caught up in the tectonic shifts that have rocked modern politics and felled the establishment on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\nTrump, the master of disruption, backed the British exit from the EU and hopes more countries follow suit -- in direct contravention of decades of US foreign policy that saw stability in a united Europe.\r\nMay did not back Brexit, but in the political carnage that followed the vote suddenly found herself prime minister and must now manage the most volatile political turbulence in Western Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall.\r\n\"I think that both Trump and May actually have strong appeal to Middle America and Middle England, and I think there are some similarities in their approach,\" said Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation.\r\n\"I would expect their partnership to actually be a very strong one even though their characters may be somewhat different in some respects,\" he predicted.\r\nGardiner believes that after falling behind Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel in the eyes of the Obama administration, the arrival of Trump is likely to repair Britain's importance to US transatlantic relations over the next four years.\r\nTrump's hostility to the European Union and equating of Brexit voters to kindred spirits with his own supporters who powered a rupturing of the political establishment also may

mayors of the nation's largest cities are quickly banding together to fight President Donald Trump's crack down on so-called sanctuary cities.\r\n\r\nTrump signed an executive order Wednesday that White House press secretary Sean Spicer said will \"strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants.\" The President reiterated his desire to target such cities Thursday when he spoke to a congressional Republican retreat.\r\nBut mayors in cities including Los Angeles, Boston and New York, as well as legal scholars, are saying not so fast. They're confident their status as sanctuary cities -- jurisdictions that have policies in place designed to limit cooperation with or involvement in federal immigration enforcement actions -- is secure.\r\nWhat are sanctuary cities?\r\nSome are pointing to Supreme Court cases that have made it difficult for Washington to punitively withdraw money from state and local governments.\r\n\"We feel very strongly that the legal case is clear,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told reporters after the executive order was announced.\r\nHe alluded to NFIB vs. Sebelius, a 2012 case that challenged aspects of former President Barack Obama's health care law. In one part of that decision, seven justices including Chief Justice John Roberts, agreed the Medicaid expansion provision under the ACA violated the Constitution by threatening to take away states' Medicaid money if they refused to comply with the expansion.\r\n\r\n\"Back then it was a different politics, maybe it's ideologically reversed, but it was loud and clear,\" Garcetti said. \"You can take away funding from a specific program if you don't adhere to the requirements of that program, but we don't have funding that is for the co-cooperation of our immigration federal officials and our local officials.\"\r\nUltimately, Garcetti said it's not up to his local police department to enforce federal immigration laws.\r\n\"They don't do immigration law any more than they do postal fraud or tax evasion,\" Garcetti said. \"That is the responsibility of the federal government.\"\r\nKaren Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigrant Law Center, said there is a long line of cases that deal with the spending clause of the US Constitution. They have underscored, she said, that the federal government can put some requirements on states when they parcel out funding, \"but it can't be unduly coercive.\"\r\n\r\nThe need for a clear correlation between an action by a state and a threat to pull federal funding, was affirmed in the 1987 case South Dakota vs. Dole. That case looked at states that wanted to have a drinking age under 21. The federal government threatened to restrict highway funding in those states because they believed the underage drinking laws affected highway safety.\r\nIn that case, the court ruled that the federal government wasn't being \"unduly coercive\" because underage drinking was indeed directly related to highway safety.\r\n\"There is a constitutional boundary there,\" Tumlin said, \"and the boundary really is coercion -- this notion of sanctity between what kinds of things localities get to decide and when the federal government can coerce them into action.\"\r\nOne of the many complex facets of how Trump's executive order will play out is the fact that the term \"sanctuary city\" has no universal meaning.\r\nPolice chiefs around the country have widely varying policies in the degree to which they cooperate with ICE agents and the lengths they will go to protect undocumented immigrants.\r\nLaw enforcement leaders in some cities have argued it is invaluable to have a strong relationship with immigrant communities -- and limit fear of deportation -- when they are trying to solve crimes. Undocumented immigrants, they note, can serve as helpful informants.\r\n\r\nBut Democratic mayors face a tricky balance.\r\nMany of them want to develop a good relationship with the Trump administration, because they see opportunities to bring dollars to their cities if the new President embarks on the major infrastructure projects he has promised. Garcetti, for example, has spoken to Trump three times since he was elected about projects that they could collaborate on.\r\nBut in the most liberal bastions of the country, mayors must also answer to their constituents who want to see path to citizenship for as many as 11 million immigrants living in the United States.\r\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh was among the most strident voices in the resistance this week -- promising that if necessary, he would \"use City Hall itself to shelter and protect anyone who is targeted unjustly.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not be intimidated by the threat to federal funding,\" Walsh said. \"We have each other's backs, and we have the Constitution of the United States of America on our side.\"\r\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared Trump's executive order to be \"vague and in some ways contradictory\" and \"very susceptible to legal challenge.\"\r\n\"If they make an attempt to pull that money, it will be from NYPD, from security funding to fight terrorism,\" de Blasio told CNN's Alisyn Camerota Thursday on \"New Day.\" \"If an attempt is made to do that, we will go to court immediately for an injunction to stop it.\"\r\nIn Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has welcomed Trump's Twitter offer to send in federal resources to reduce Chicago's shooting and killings, told reporters that the executive order wouldn't change anything.\r\n\"We are going to stay a sanctuary city,\" he said during a press conference.\r\nNoting the executive order lacked any detail about what funds would be taken away, he decided to highlight the positive.\r\n\"I'm going to take the President's offer to give us resources, and that's where I'm going to focus,\" Emanuel said.", "fivelinesummary": "\"We feel very strongly that the legal case

significantly Russia's Vladimir Putin and Germany's Angela Merkel -- in what may be his biggest day of diplomacy yet.\r\nSaturday's call will be Trump's first phone conversation with the Russian President since his inauguration last week, and one whose outcome will be closely studied.\r\nBoth Trump and Putin have said they would like to see warmer ties between their two nations. However, relations between Trump and his team and Russia have been under scrutiny following allegations that Moscow meddled in the US election last year.\r\nSpeaking Friday at his first White House news conference, Trump indicated a willingness to work with Moscow.\r\nBut he said it was \"too early\" to discuss removing sanctions that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, imposed on Russia.\r\n\"We'll see what happens,\" Trump said of the call, which Vice President Mike Pence will also join.\r\n\"We're looking to have a great relationship with all countries,\" Trump said. \"If we can have a great relationship with Russia and China and all countries I'm all for that.\"\r\nOn Friday night, however, a senior administration official said the current plan was not to lift the Russian sanctions.\r\nThe Kremlin has sought to lower expectations, suggesting Putin is simply calling as a matter of protocol to congratulate the US leader on his inauguration.\r\nBut there is some excitement in Russia about a possible detente between Washington and Moscow under the Trump administration.\r\nObama imposed sanctions on Russia throughout his eight years in office and earlier this month expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the United States over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.\r\n\r\nFlurry of calls\r\nBefore he speaks with Putin, Trump will hold calls with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a key ally in Asia, and Merkel.\r\nLater Saturday, he will speak with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Pence is not listed as joining any of those calls.\r\nTrump's calls with Abe and Turnbull come days after he signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, a massive trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration that Congress had not yet ratified. Both Abe and Turnbull had supported TPP.\r\nThe flurry of telephone diplomacy comes a day after Trump received his first foreign leader at the White House, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, who announced that Trump will make a state visit to the UK.\r\nIn a speech to US Republicans, May urged Trump to tread carefully as he deals with Russia, saying: \"With President Putin, my advice is to engage but beware.\"\r\nTrump also spoke on the phone Friday with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto after a row over his plans for a wall along the US-Mexico border culminated in Pe\u00f1a Nieto canceling a planned trip to Washington.\r\n\r\nFences to mend?\r\nTrump's call with the German Chancellor may not be the easiest of the day.\r\nIn an interview this month with the Times of London and the German publication Bild, the US President called Merkel \"by far the most important leader\" in Europe -- but was critical of the welcome she has extended to refugees.\r\n\"I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from. And nobody even knows where they come from,\" Trump said in that interview.\r\nHe also appeared to undermine the European Union, currently grappling with the prospect of Britain's exit, saying: \"You look at the European Union and it's Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That's why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out.\"\r\nMerkel -- who is running for a fourth term in office later this year and faces criticism from political opponents over her refugee policy -- declined to comment on Trump's remarks.\r\nBut at the time of Trump's election in November, she made it clear that Germany's cooperation would depend on how he acts.\r\n\"Germany and the United States (are) joined by common values -- democracy, freedom, respect for the law and human dignity -- regardless of skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political beliefs,\" she said. \"Based on these values, I offer close cooperation to the future president.\"\r\n\r\nHollande outspoken\r\nTrump may also have to build bridges with France, traditionally a close ally of the United States.\r\nHollande, who will stand down as President this spring, was outspoken at a joint news conference Friday with Merkel about the \"challenges\" the Trump administration poses for Europe in terms of trade and global diplomacy.\r\n\"We of course have to speak to Donald Trump, as he was chosen by the Americans to be their President. But we have to do it with a European point of view and promote our interests and values,\" he said in Berlin.\r\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and his newly appointed German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, also presented a united European front in a joint news conference Saturday in Paris ahead of Trump's calls.\r\n\"We are convinced that a strong Europe is in the interest of all Europeans, and the world, and in the interest of the United States itself,\" Ayrault said.\r\n\"Not only with the current US President, but also with another US administration, the relationship might have changed,\" Gabriel said. \"We have to be confident in dealing with this reality.

"title": "Trump's immigration ban sends shockwaves", "content": "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's seismic move to ban more than 100 million people from the United States and to deny entry to all refugees reverberated worldwide Saturday, as chaos and confusion rippled through US law enforcement agencies, airports and foreign capitals trying to grasp the US's new policy.\r\n\r\nAt John F. Kennedy International Airport, where passengers can often spot the Statue of Liberty on their descent into New York, two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the US were detained and prevented from exiting the airport. Customs and Border Protection officials cited Trump's new executive order, which bans citizens of Iraq and six other Muslim-majority countries -- a total of at least 134 million people -- from entering the US for the next 90 days. It also suspends the admission of all refugees for 120 days.\r\nOne of the men, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, worked with the US government for 10 years after the US invaded Iraq. He was released early Saturday afternoon due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US, a source with knowledge of the case told CNN.\r\nThe other man, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who had worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the US as refugees. It was not immediately clear how many other cases like Darweesh and Alshawi's were cropping up at other US airports, which had no time to prepare for the new immigration rule that took effect immediately with Trump's signature Friday afternoon.\r\nTheir attorneys filed a federal lawsuit Saturday morning challenging Trump's executive order, likely just the first of many challenges in the legal fight many groups plan to wage to overturn Trump's actions.\r\n\"President Trump's war on equality is already taking a terrible human toll. This ban cannot be allowed to continue,\" the American Civil Liberties Union, which joined the lawsuit, said in a statement Saturday.\r\nTrump on Friday said that his actions would \"keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.\"\r\n\"We don't want them here,\" Trump said as he signed the order. \"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\"\r\nAt the Cairo International Airport, Egyptian officials on Saturday began to turn back US-bound refugees and citizens of the seven countries now barred from entering the US.\r\n\"They (airport personnel) have no choice but to follow orders. I don't want to blame anyone here,\" a Cairo Airport official said. \"This is a new era we are witnessing.\"\r\nAirlines, meanwhile, scrambled to understand the new US policy and worked to warn passengers who might be affected before they boarded their flights.\r\nQatar Airways posted a travel alert on its website warning nationals of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen that they could not travel to the US unless they are government officials, diplomats or representatives of international organizations. The German airline Lufthansa said it was not yet \"in the position to outline the effect\" given the new US immigration rule had only just been announced.\r\nSwift condemnation\r\nIran, one of the countries whose citizens were banned, slammed Trump's immigration order on Saturday as an \"insult\" and a \"gift to extremists\" and said it would swiftly reciprocate by banning US citizens from Iran.\r\n\"The US decision to restrict travel for Muslims to the US, even if for a temporary period of three months, is an obvious insult to the Islamic world and in particular to the great nation of Iran,\" Iran's foreign ministry said in a statement Saturday. \"Despite the claims of combating terrorism and keeping American people safe, it will be recorded in history as a big gift to extremists and their supporters.\"\r\nThe disarray also fell against a backdrop of swift condemnation from human rights groups and national security experts.\r\nThe International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian aid and refugee assistance group, called Trump's decision to suspend refugee admissions \"harmful and hasty\" and noted that the US refugee program \"makes it harder to get to the United States as a refugee than any other route.\" Refugees must undergo an extensive vetting process -- it typically takes more than two years to be admitted to the US as a refugee.\r\n\"In truth, refugees are fleeing terror -- they are not terrorists,\" David Miliband, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement. \"And at a time when there are more refugees than ever, America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\"\r\nThe International Organization for Migration and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, stressed the importance of the US resettlement program for refugees and stressed that \"the needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater.\"\r\nThose two organizations also expressed concern about the provision in Trump's executive order that would prioritize Christians fleeing persecution and conflict in Muslim-majority countries over Muslims fleeing those same countries.\r\n\"We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\" UNHCR and IOM said in a joint statement Saturday.\r\nAbed Ayoub, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee's legal and policy director, said Trump's executive order has sown \"complete chaos.\"\r\nAyoub said his group has already fielded calls from people around the world impacted by Trump's executive order, including from students and legal US residents who are citizens of the seven countries banned by Trump and are now stuck overseas.\r\nHe said his organization fielded a call from a student who was blocked in Turkey from traveling to the US and cannot return to her studies in the US as well as other students on international trips who now cannot return to the US.\r\nAyoub said the executive order \"is causing a really destructive impact on the Arab and Muslim community and on the Iranian community in the US.\"\r\nDemocrats also slammed Trump's executive order, arguing his action establishing a religious test for entry is unconstitutional and un-American.\r\nJust as they did during the campaign, national security experts also warned that Trump's plans to deny refugees entry in the United States and target Muslims or Muslim-majority countries through an immigration ban would be counter-productive or ineffective methods of protecting the US from future terrorist attacks.\r\n\"This banning of refugees is kind of a red herring,\" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said on Saturday. \"It's not going to make any difference to the terrorism issue, which is overwhelmingly a United States problem. Because 9/11, of course, was carried out by 19 foreign-born Arab terrorists, I think we tend to conceive of this as a problem that comes from outside, when in fact, it's really a problem that is internal to the United States right now.\"\r\n\"It's one of those things that sounds like it makes sense, but it doesn't really when you look at the facts,\" Bergen said.\r\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday, however, commended Trump for his executive order, noting, \"our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland.\"\r\n\"We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it's time to reevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process,\" Ryan said. \"President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.\"\r\nMore countries could be added to banned list\r\nThe Trump administration's action on Friday also indefinitely suspended admissions for Syrian refugees. The order also called on the secretary of homeland security to conduct a 30-day review to determine whether additional countries should be added to the ban.\r\nA senior White House official told CNN on Friday that the list of seven countries whose citizens are now banned from the US was likely just a starting point.\r\nThe official said the administration would be \"very aggressive\" as it weighs how many more countries to add to the list.\r\nAsked what criteria the administration will consider as it looks to expand the ban, the official said simply the \"mandate is to keep America safe.\"\r\n\"Not going to take any risks,\" the official added.\r\nBut if that is the goal, many national security experts questioned why Trump's executive order focused on banning foreign nationals from the US.\r\nCitizens and legal US residents have carried out all deadly radical Islamist terrorist attacks in the US since 9/11 -- not by foreigners visiting the US on a travel visa or by Syrian

Anti-Discrimination Committee's legal and policy director, said Trump's executive order has sown \"complete chaos.\"\r\n\"This banning of refugees is kind of a red herring,\" CNN national security

said.\r\n\"President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.\"\r\nMore countries could be added to banned list The Trump administration's action on Friday also indefinitely suspended admissions for Syrian refugees.\r\nThe official said the administration would be \"very aggressive\" as it weighs how many more countries to add to the list.\r\nBut if that is the goal, many national security experts questioned why Trump's executive order focused on banning foreign nationals from the US.", "photo":

sawtooth autograph on documents he hopes will stake out a sharply conservative agenda over the next four years and beyond.\r\n\r\nShaping his administration's policy through orders and memoranda on everything from health care to oil pipelines to immigration, Trump is collecting evidence of campaign promises fulfilled.\r\nBut if he hopes to see his vows realized fully, the unilateral moves this week won't suffice; he'll need cooperation from Congress and buy-in from Republicans and Democrats alike to push forward with ideas he claims will reshape the American economy for the better.\r\nLike presidents before him, Trump has issued a flurry of actions as an opening salvo to his government, denouncing on paper some of President Barack Obama's chief accomplishments: his signature health care law, his massive Pacific trade deal, and his decision to scuttle the Keystone XL oil pipeline.\r\nAlso like his predecessors, Trump will find his powers to enact major changes are limited.

Most, however, won't prompt action right away.\r\nAn order on Obamacare -- signed hours after Trump was sworn into office -- issued a broad mandate for heads of federal agencies to \"minimize the economic burden\" of the health care law, but didn't recommend any single action that could roll back the Affordable Care Act's programs.\r\nThe document clarified that actions are only allowed to the \"maximum extent permitted by law,\" which underscores that major changes to Obamacare, like the individual mandate, will require legislation. Lawmakers have begun the repeal process, but many are wary of removing the law without a clear replacement plan.\r\nSpeaking at a GOP retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday, Trump acknowledged that some Republicans in Congress were advocating a cautious approach toward repealing the Affordable Care Act. He said he'd discussed with House Speaker Paul Ryan delaying action for two years.\r\n\"I think we have no choice. We have to get it going,\" he said. \"If we waited two years, it's going to explode like you've never seen an explosion. Nobody is going to be able to afford it. It's a disaster.\"\r\nTrump's action on Wednesday ordering construction to begin on a border wall will require congressional partnership, too. The project is estimated to cost up to $15 billion, funds that lawmakers will need to approve. The White House said Thursday it had discussed a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to fund the project, but called it only one idea of many.\r\nNot all Republican lawmakers have endorsed Trump's combative approach toward Mexico. Several Republicans privately say they are worried that the new president is starting a trade war with one of the country's most significant trading partners -- and could drive up the debt in the process.\r\n\"He's going to start a war,\" said one senior GOP source who asked not to be named.\r\nIn other orders, Trump was merely reiterating the existing political reality.\r\nTrump's executive order withdrawing the US from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal was largely a symbolic move -- the measure was never ratified, and never received a vote in Congress, and thus required no action on the part of the president to withdraw. Even if it was ratified, there was little likelihood that Trump would approve it.\r\nAn order halting hiring at non-military agencies contained wide exemptions for jobs \"necessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities,\" which is a broad definition. It also exempted military hiring, which accounts for a third of federal jobs.\r\nTrump's order allowing the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines to proceed was a shift in policy, but the projects are still a long way from getting started. Trump himself said the US would renegotiate the terms of the pipelines, which implies a lengthy process with several competing interests.\r\nAnd a regulatory freeze was a near exact replica of executive orders that the past two Presidents have had their chiefs of staff issue at the beginning of their administrations. The move halts any item currently in the regulatory process -- a move that isn't a surprise given the change in administration.\r\n\"One of the functions of these executive instruments is to give instructions to different bits of federal bureaucracy,\" said Aziz Huq of the Law School at the University of Chicago. He suggested that the executive actions and orders need to be viewed separately.\r\n\"There are many elements of the orders that are well understood to give instruction to federal agencies,\" he

admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants.\r\n\r\nTitled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" the executive order would start to make good on Trump's promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States.\r\nThe text of the order -- in a break from drafts that had been circulating earlier this week -- drops a longtime Trump campaign pledge to establish safe zones in Syria to give Syrian nationals displaced by the ongoing civil war in the country a place to relocate.\r\nThe order bars all persons from certain terror-prone countries from entering the United States for 90 days and suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted.\r\nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.\r\n\"I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry,\" the order signed by Trump reads.\r\nThe total number of refugees admitted into the United States would also be capped during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000.\r\n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon after the swearing-in of Defense Secretary James Mattis. \"We don't want them here.\"\r\nHe added, \"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\"\r\nTrump's order will also cancel the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which once allowed repeat travelers to the United States to be able to forgo an in-person interview to renew their visa. Under the new order, these travelers will now have to have in-person interviews.\r\nAt the Pentagon, Trump met privately for about an hour with Mattis, Vice President Mike Pence, Security Adviser Mike Flynn and military officials and they discussed accelerating the defeat of ISIS, confronting global threats like North Korea, military readiness and the National Guard, a Defense official told CNN. The meeting took place in \"the tank,\" secure room where the Joint Chiefs meet.\r\nTrump also signed a second executive action on Friday that would spur military spending and, as Trump said, \"begin the great rebuilding of the Armed Services of the United States.\"\r\nThe President added that the executive action instructs Mattis to begin \"developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources and new tools for our men and women in uniform.\"\r\nTrump's order on refugees has been something the White House has been considering for days and the President was seen with the document on his Air Force One desk Thursday when he flew to Philadelphia.\r\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan praised Trump's orders on Friday.\r\n\"Our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland.

Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians.

the Department of Homeland Security leeway to prioritize refugee claims made by people \"on the basis of religious based persecution\" as long as the person applying for refugee status is \"a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\"\r\nThis would make it easier for Christians and other religious minorities in majority Muslim countries from entering the United States than it

Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president\u2019s team never talked with him about it.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nWhite House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325,000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel.\r\n\r\nReince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. \u201cWe\u2019re not willing to be wrong on this subject,\u201d he said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cPresident Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States.\r\n\r\nWith thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. \u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cThis is not about religion \u2014 this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. \u201cWe will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the long-running civil war in Syria. \u201cI have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors.\r\n\r\nAs late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from majority-Muslim nations.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nIn a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\u201cChristians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe cannot allow this horror to continue!\u201d\r\n\r\nHis order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago.\r\n\r\nNew York\u2019s attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was \u201cin compliance with judicial orders.\u201d\r\n\r\nAffected by Trump\u2019s order?

If you have information, please contact us at immigration@nytimes.com.\r\n\r\nStill, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained.\r\n\r\nThe lawmakers arrived after 3 p.m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington.\r\n\r\nHis staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and \u201cthey said we\u2019ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,\u201d Mr. Connolly said.\r\n\r\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That\u2019s where the problem is, and that\u2019s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to \u201cclaw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nThe mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. \u201cWe have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,\u201d he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York.\r\n\r\nThe order roiled relations with America\u2019s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she \u201cis convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief.\u201d\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey.\r\n\r\nBut under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did \u201cnot agree with this kind of approach.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump\u2019s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans.\r\n\r\n\u201cShame,\u201d they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo hate, no fear,\u201d they added later. \u201cRefugees are welcome here.\u201d\r\n\r\nSecurity fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nSome Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. \u201cThis executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,\u201d Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. \u201cThat is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the issue.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs\u2019 donor network. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was \u201cpoorly implemented\u201d and urged the president to \u201cmake appropriate revisions.\u201d Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. \u201cThey are sadly weak

Secretary Jim Mattis plans to send the White House a list of Iraqi citizens who have served with American forces with the recommendation that they be exempt from President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, administration officials said on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon list is intended to address a major criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration: that it will stop the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection.\r\n\r\nSome Iraqi military officials with family in the United States, who have also reportedly been affected by the decree, could also benefit from the Pentagon list, which will also be sent to the Department of Homeland Security.\r\n\r\nSecretary Mattis was not consulted by the White House during the preparation of the executive order on immigration, which temporarily blocks Iraqi citizens from entering the United States for 90 days. Six other predominantly Muslim countries are covered by the edict: Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Iran.\r\n\r\nThe White House has argued that the temporary ban is needed so that the United States can develop procedures for the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of travelers from nations that have been stricken by terrorism. Officials said that the Iraqis who will be put on the Pentagon list have already undergone a stringent form of vetting: serving with the United States military in combat.\r\n\r\nCalm down, Trump says, few were detained\r\n\r\nBesieged by criticism, with chaos at international airports mounting and protests proliferating, Mr. Trump defended the aftermath of his executive order halting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying that problems at airports were the fault of a Delta Airline computer error.\r\n\r\nDelta said it fixed its system problems after a few hours on Sunday night. The chaos lasted the whole weekend.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nAlso, if there ever was a Mr. Nice Guy, he is no more.\r\n\r\nAnd, the president said, he had to spring the order on the world \u2014 the element of surprise keeps the nation safe. Also, he seems to have acknowledged that it is a \u201cban,\u201d a term the Trump administration has denounced as hyperbole.\r\n\r\nThat swipe at Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, was a reference to the senator choking up on Sunday as he recounted his family\u2019s immigrant experience.\r\n\r\nJewish Republican groups mildly peeved at White House\r\n\r\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition and the Zionist Organization of America have tried really hard to stay on Mr. Trump\u2019s good side.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign, when Trump supporters unloaded vicious anti-Semitic invectives on journalists, the Republican Jewish Coalition condemned expressions of hate by supporters of all candidates. The Zionist Organization of America latched on to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d program and backed his conservative, pro-settler pick to be ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman.\r\n\r\nWhen the White House released a statement on Friday commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day without mentioning Jews, they were pretty quiet, even as the Anti-Defamation League condemned the omission.\r\n\r\nBut on Sunday, after Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, confirmed that the decision to not mention Jews in the statement was intentional, the two Jewish groups were upset, mildly. Ms. Hicks justified the decision by saying, \u201cDespite what the media reports, we are an incredibly inclusive group and we took into account all of those who suffered.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition, not exactly sputtering with rage, released a statement:\r\n\r\n\u201cAs supporters of President Trump, we know that he holds in his heart the memory of the six million victims of the Holocaust, and is committed not just to their memory, but ensuring it never happens again.\u201d \u201cThe lack of a direct statement about the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust was an unfortunate omission. History unambiguously shows the purpose of the Nazi\u2019s final solution was the extermination of the Jews of Europe. We hope, going forward, he conveys those feelings when speaking about the Holocaust.\u201d\r\n\r\nMorton A. Klein, the national president of Zionist Organization of America, was a little stronger:\r\n\r\n\u201cEspecially as a child of Holocaust survivors, I and Z.O.A. are compelled to express our chagrin and deep pain at President Trump, in his Holocaust Remembrance Day message, omitting any mention of anti-Semitism and the six million Jews who were targeted and murdered by the German Nazi regime and others.\u201d\r\n\r\nReince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, did not sound all that apologetic on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d: \u201cI mean, everyone\u2019s suffering in the Holocaust, including obviously all of the Jewish people affected, and the miserable genocide that occurred is something that we consider to be extraordinarily sad and something that can never be forgotten,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nOh, and he mentioned that some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family \u2014 alluding to Ivanka, his daughter, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law \u2014 are Jewish.\r\n\r\nTrump\u2019s other objective: Call it ISIS\r\n\r\nMr. Trump said during the campaign that he had a secret plan to fight the Islamic State. Eight days into his presidency, he seems to have revealed a small part of it.\r\n\r\nCall it ISIS.\r\n\r\nAn executive memorandum that Mr. Trump signed in the Oval Office on Saturday afternoon repeatedly referred to the Islamic State as ISIS \u2014 not ISIL, as former President Barack Obama and the rest of the federal government called the terrorist group; and not Daesh, the Arabic acronym for the group, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it while standing next to the president last week in the East Room of the White House.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the plan to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, in other words, ISIS,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he signed the memorandum, which called on the Pentagon to devise a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d within 30 days.\r\n\r\nThis is a big issue for the president. As he said in late 2015, before his campaign heated up:\r\n\r\nIn May 2016, Mr. Trump again brought up the issue, saying in an interview with Bloomberg Politics: \u201cThe president of the United States always says \u2018ISIL.\u2019 Everyone else says \u2018ISIS.\u2019 And I actually think he does it to bother people.\u201d\r\n\r\nRush Limbaugh accused Mr. Obama of using ISIL to delegitimize Israel \u2014 naturally. (Don\u2019t ask, it doesn\u2019t make sense.)\r\n\r\nIn fact, the former president thought the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant was more delegitimizing than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which denoted the territory the group holds.\r\n\r\nWell, elections have consequences.\r\n\r\nRepublicans and the art of saying nothing\r\n\r\nDemocratic lawmakers greeted Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order barring visitors and immigrants from seven Muslim nations with unmistakable broadsides.\r\n\r\nAs protests mounted and criticism grew, Republicans slowly began to speak out, but most of the coordinated response seemed to be, We like what the president is doing, and maybe he could have done things a little differently.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nTake Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, who once called the Obama administration the most corrupt presidency in history, until Mr. Issa nearly lost his seat and claimed he had cooperated with Mr. Obama. His district appears to be getting more ethnically diverse, but it still has affluent Republican strongholds that have helped him remain in power since 2003. The statement takes the Republican nonposition to an art form:\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerica is a nation of immigrants. Our country has been built by the hard work of those who\u2019ve come here for liberty and to find hope in a land of opportunity. A welcoming America is not incompatible with a strong and secure America. We can put in place a vetting process that the American people have confidence in. To do so, the Congress must work with the administration to swiftly reestablish strong and clear screening procedures so that our rich tradition of immigration is not permanently threatened by those who wish us harm.\u201d\r\n\r\nDemocrats demand investigation into Homeland Security actions\r\n\r\nRichard J. Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, Illinois\u2019 two Democratic senators, demanded an independent investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security into the way it carried out Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration from seven Muslim nations.\r\n\r\nThe call came amid reports that Customs and Border Protection repeatedly ignored judicial orders to release travelers from detention facilities at airports across the country.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are particularly alarmed by allegations that C.B.P. officers and potentially other department personnel failed to comply with a temporary restraining order,\u201d they wrote.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe United States Constitution means little if law enforcement agents disregard it, or if Americans are unwilling to defend its principles and respect foundational constitutional rights, from due process to equal protection under the law. The American people are relying on your independent investigators to serve as a check against a powerful law enforcement agency that may be violating the civil rights of LPRs and operating in violation of the law.\u201d\r\n\r\nJordanian king will have breakfast with Pence\r\n\r\nJordan\u2019s king, Abdullah II, is scheduled to have breakfast on Monday with Vice President Mike Pence at the vice president\u2019s residence a few miles from the White House. He would certainly like to get a little closer than that.\r\n\r\nAmid turmoil over Mr. Trump\u2019s order to halt entries from seven predominantly Muslim countries, the king probably has issues he would like to bring up with the man signing the executive orders. But Mr. Trump does not appear keen to host Abdullah II at the White House, certainly not before Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, pays a visit.\r\n\r\nJordan\u2019s king will also be meeting with leaders on Capitol Hill. They are likely to get an earful.\r\n\r\nTo criticize Trump, senators lean on a friend\r\n\r\nMaybe senators are so scared of Mr. Trump that they need a friend for support.\r\n\r\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Mr. Trump offered few details as the campaign progressed, and as president-elect he promised to protect the country from terrorists with only vague promises of \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bannon, who believes in highly restrictive immigration policies and saw barring refugees as vital to shoring up Mr. Trump\u2019s political base, was determined to make it happen. He and a small group made up of the president\u2019s closest advisers began working on the order during the transition so that Mr. Trump could sign it soon after taking office.\r\n\r\nA senior administration official said that the order was drafted in cooperation with some immigration experts on Capitol Hill and members of the \u201cbeachhead teams\u201d \u2014 small groups of political appointees sent by the new White House to be liaisons and begin work at the agencies.\r\n\r\nJames Jay Carafano, a vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, said that little of that work was shared with career officials at the Homeland Security Department, the State Department or other agencies.\r\n\r\nThere was \u201ca firewall between the old administration and the incoming one,\u201d Mr. Carafano said.\r\n\r\nOne reason, he said, is that when the Trump transition team asked pointed questions suggesting new policies to the career officials, those questions were swiftly leaked to the news media, generating negative stories. So the Trump team began to limit the information they discussed with officials from the previous administration.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy share it with them?\u201d Mr. Carafano said.\r\n\r\nR. Gil Kerlikowske, who served as commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama, said that his staff had little communication with Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, who made no mention of a bar on entry for people from certain countries.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nWhite House officials in the meantime insisted to reporters at a briefing that Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers had been in contact with officials at the State and Homeland Security Departments for \u201cmany weeks.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne official added, \u201cEveryone who needed to know was informed.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut that apparently did not include members of the president\u2019s own cabinet.\r\n\r\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Last summer, Mr. Mattis sharply criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration as a move that was \u201ccausing us great damage right now, and it\u2019s sending shock waves through the international system.\u201d\r\n\r\nCustoms and Border Protection officers were also caught unaware.\r\n\r\nThey contacted several airlines late Friday that were likely to be carrying passengers from the seven countries and \u201cinstructed the airlines to offload any passport holders from those countries,\u201d said a state government official who has been briefed on the agency\u2019s actions.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 3 a.m. on Saturday that customs and border officials received limited written instructions about what to do at airports and border crossings. They also struggled with how to exercise the waiver authority that was included in the executive order, which allowed the homeland security secretary to let some individuals under the ban enter the country case by case.\r\n\r\nOne customs officer, who declined to be quoted by name, said he was given a limited briefing about what to do as he went to his post on Saturday morning, but even managers seemed unclear. People at the agency were blindsided, he said, and are still trying to figure things out, even as people are being stopped from coming into the United States.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the secretary doesn\u2019t know anything, how could we possibly know anything at this level?\u201d the officer said, referring to Mr. Kelly.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nAt the Citizenship and Immigration Service, staff members were told that the agency should stop work on any application filed by a person from any of the countries listed in the ban. Employees were told that applicants should be interviewed, but that their cases for citizenship, green cards or other immigration documents should be put on pause, pending further guidance.\r\n\r\nThe timing of the executive order and the lack of advance warning had homeland security officials \u201cflying by the seat of their pants,\u201d to try to put policies in place, one official said.\r\n\r\nBy Saturday, as the order stranded travelers around the world and its full impact became clear, Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, became increasingly upset about how the program had been rolled out and communicated to the public.\r\n\r\nBy Sunday morning, Mr. Priebus had to defend the immigration ban on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where he insisted that the executive order was rolled out smoothly. He also backpedaled on the policy and said that the executive order\u2019s restrictions on entry to the United States would not apply to legal permanent residents \u201cgoing forward.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs White House officials also insisted on Sunday that the order had gone through the usual process of scrutiny and approval by the Office of Legal Counsel, the continuing confusion forced Mr. Kelly to clarify the waiver situation. He issued a statement making clear that lawful permanent residents \u2014 those who hold valid green cards \u2014 would be granted a waiver to enter the United States unless information suggested that they were a security threat.\r\n\r\nBut senior White House officials insisted on Sunday night that the executive order would remain in force despite the change, and that they were proud of taking actions that they said would help protect Americans against threats from potential terrorists.\r\n\r\nThat assertion is likely to do little to calm the public furor, which showed no signs of waning at the beginning of Mr. Trump\u2019s second full week in the Oval Office.\r\n\r\nMr. Carafano said he believed that the substance of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order was neither radical nor unreasonable. But he said that Mr. Trump\u2019s team could have delayed signing the order until they had better prepared the bureaucracy to carry it out.\r\n\r\nHe also said the president and his team had not done a good job of communicating to the public the purpose of the executive order.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\n\u201cIf there is a criticism of the administration, and I think there is, I think they have done a rotten job of telling their story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not like they did not know they were going to do this.

\u201celites\u201d had traveled by used car, subway and gypsy cab to the church in the low-income neighborhood that Mr. Barrett championed. And in truth, no one at the service seemed ruffled by all that Washington bluster about them.\r\n\r\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time some millionaire, billionaire or politician (or combo thereof) tried to tell them to shut up. The thing was, after decades of layoffs and strikes, unrelenting economic pressure and a succession of political leaders who threw chairs and swung brooms at them \u2014 figuratively and sometimes literally \u2014 they were still there. It was the politicians and their tough-talking lieutenants who came and went.\r\n\r\nYes, their numbers are dwindling. And here they were, losing another revered one of their own. But Mr. Barrett appeared to time his death as an inspiring message to his colleagues that the journalistic values he represented \u2014 brutal honesty and tenacity \u2014 can and must survive him and, more important, the new administration that seems so intent on gutting them.\r\n\r\nPhoto\r\n\r\nDespite what Mr. Trump and his aides say about journalists, those among the congregation \u2014 representing just about every major news organization based in New York \u2014 were never in it for \u201capproval ratings\u201d or \u201cpower.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey are in it for the same reasons that Mr. Barrett was: to follow the reporting wherever it went, however messy and imperfect the process and whatever the consequences for himself \u2014 like the time a Bronx power broker he was investigating tackled and choked him.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nAn openly ideological journalist who spent most of his 40-plus-year career at The Village Voice, Mr. Barrett never let people off the hook just because they leaned in the same political direction he did. And he didn\u2019t let facts become fungible for his own causes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWayne was an equal-opportunity assailant to anybody he thought was violating the public trust \u2014 there\u2019s no question about that,\u201d an old friend and colleague of his, the investigative journalist Tom Robbins, told me. \u201cHe was always after the sin and not the sinner.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo it was that this self-described \u201cprogressive\u201d (along with his mentor Jack Newfield) produced much of the reporting that exposed the corruption of the Koch administration and the Democratic Party machine in Queens; blistered the administration of Gov. Mario Cuomo as the \u201cSleaze Team\u201d and \u201cTammany Hall North\u201d; and found alleged campaign finance abuses that almost got the current Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer \u2014 then a brand-new congressman \u2014 indicted. He also reported on financial dealings that sullied the mayoralty of David N. Dinkins.\r\n\r\nYet Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Cuomo\u2019s son, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, were among the mourners on Friday.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to the congregation, Mr. Schumer said that through Mr. Barrett\u2019s work \u2014 which included a scathing piece about his presence at a birthday party for the colorful lawyer and former McCarthy aide Roy M. Cohn \u2014 \u201cI learned a bit of humility.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

There was his Village Voice cover story pinning some of the blame for the 2008 housing crisis on Mr. Cuomo; a more recent Daily News piece knocked the governor\u2019s approach to campaign finance.

into focus on Monday, when President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto declared that negotiations for a future relationship with the United States would not be limited to trade.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will bring to the table all themes,\u201d he said in a speech. \u201cTrade, yes, but also migration and the themes of security, including border security, terrorist threats and the traffic of illegal drugs, weapons and cash.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis hope is that by introducing broader uncertainty about the bilateral relationship \u2014 Will Mexico still cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking? Will it stop foreign terrorists from using Mexico as a way station into the United States? \u2014 Mexico can raise the stakes enough for Mr. Trump to reconsider his \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to commerce.\r\n\r\n\u201cMexico has a lot of chips to play,\u201d said Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former foreign secretary who has staked out a combative approach.\r\n\r\nLet Mr. Trump pull the United States out of Nafta, he argues. Instead of stopping Central American migrants at its southern border, Mexico should let them through on their way to the United States. \u201cAnd let\u2019s see if his wall keeps the terrorists out, because we won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Casta\u00f1eda added.\r\n\r\nThe view from Mexico City is not uniformly bleak. Some analysts believe there is a potential for a situation in which a new Nafta benefits all. \u201cI have always believed one should never let a good crisis go to waste,\u201d said Arturo Sarukh\u00e1n, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. \u201cThere is an opportunity that we could end up modernizing and improving Nafta.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe view that there is a potential silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s hostility toward Nafta is also popular in some Washington circles. The quarter-century-old agreement is due for some modernization anyway, if only to deal with things like data protection, online crime and e-commerce \u2014 which were not around in the early 1990s. Nafta\u2019s weak provisions on labor and environmental standards could also be improved.\r\n\r\nMany aspects of Nafta could be upgraded, trade experts say. It could do with new rules to open up government projects to bidders from all three Nafta partners. Allowing long-haul trucking companies from Mexico and the United States into each other\u2019s markets could make trade between the two more efficient. What\u2019s more, the Mexican-American border could benefit from more infrastructure investments to integrate energy networks, reduce clogged lines at border crossings and the like.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nNow that Mr. Trump has formally nixed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have tied North America and nine other nations from the Pacific Rim into one large trade bloc, some of its provisions could be drafted into a new North American deal.\r\n\r\nGary Hufbauer of the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington suggests that the name \u201cNafta\u201d be retired \u2014 it has a bad reputation.

But one can\u2019t quickly eliminate a $60 billion trade surplus with a new Nafta \u2014 not unless it has some incredibly draconian limits on imports or local content requirements that could be as damaging to Mexico as abandoning the pact altogether.\r\n\r\nMany Mexican officials fear that it is precisely this kind of draconian change that Mr. Trump has in mind. It would be politically profitable, at least in the short term. And it would signal toughness to China \u2014 a more formidable rival that is next on Mr. Trump\u2019s list. If Canada stays out of the fray, cutting a separate deal with the United States to replace Nafta, Mexico would be left alone in an existential fight for its future.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Mexico may have no choice but to raise the stakes and hope to arrive at the negotiating table with a threat at least as credible as Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to pull out of the deal.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump\u2019s negotiating position does have some soft spots. For one, said Mickey Kantor, the American trade negotiator who concluded the Nafta negotiations during the Clinton administration, \u201che is under pressure to deliver a deal.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf Mexico stands its ground and even allows Nafta to dissolve, it would send its own signal to China: Resistance is not futile. And Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to raise tariffs against Mexico to 35 percent could easily be challenged under the rules of the World Trade Organization.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, a hugely risky strategy for Mexico. When Mr. Trump entered the presidential race in June 2015, a dollar was worth about 15 pesos. Now it\u2019s worth about 22. A frontal confrontation with the United States might send it to 40, Mexican officials fear, fueling capital flight.\r\n\r\nAnd yet that may be Mexico\u2019s strongest card.\r\n\r\nAs noted by C. Fred Bergsten, director emeritus of the Peterson Institute, an irony of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to Mexico is that by weakening the peso so much, he is going to increase the bilateral trade deficit, increase Mexico\u2019s competitiveness and make it more attractive for American companies to invest there. \u201cThat is going to swamp anything he achieves with his company-by-company efforts,\u201d he added.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s if Mexico manages to hold on. The more ominous situation is one in which the United States pushes too hard and Mexico \u2014 its economy, its unpopular government, its public order and political stability \u2014 buckles.

The action stranded travelers around the world, led to protests around the country and created alarm inside the bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nPhoto\r\n\r\nMs. Yates, like other senior government officials, was caught by surprise by the executive order and agonized over the weekend about how to respond, two Justice Department officials involved in the weekend deliberations said. Ms. Yates considered resigning but she told colleagues she did not want to leave it to her successor to face the same dilemma.\r\n\r\nBy Monday afternoon, Ms. Yates added to a deepening sense of anxiety in the nation\u2019s capital by publicly confronting the president with a stinging challenge to his authority, laying bare a deep divide at the Justice Department, within the diplomatic corps and elsewhere in the government over the wisdom of his order.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful,\u201d Ms. Yates wrote in a letter to Justice Department lawyers.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump\u2019s senior aides huddled together in the West Wing to determine what to do.\r\n\r\nThey decided quickly that her insubordination could not stand, according to administration official familiar with the deliberations. Among the chief concerns was whether Mr. Sessions could be confirmed quickly by the Senate.\r\n\r\nAfter Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, received reassurances from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, that the confirmation was on track, aides took their recommendation to Mr. Trump in the White House residence.\r\n\r\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

She also alluded to unspecified statements the White House had made before signing the order, which she factored into her review.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump initially responded to the letter with a post on Twitter at 7:45 p.m., complaining that the Senate\u2019s delay in confirming his cabinet nominees had resulted in leaving Ms. Yates in place.\r\n\r\nThe 1973 \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d led to a constitutional crisis that ended when Robert H.

Corporate chieftains from Detroit to Silicon Valley sharply criticized the ban, saying it was inconsistent with their values. Mr. Trump also faced mounting legal challenges, as two Democratic-leaning states, Massachusetts and Washington, signaled they would attack the policy in court and a Muslim advocacy group filed a lawsuit calling it an unconstitutional religious test.\r\n\r\nAt the White House, where questions about the ban overshadowed all other issues on Monday, Mr. Spicer acknowledged the State Department\u2019s dissent channel has long been a way for its staff to register objections over administration policies.

They can sign a final version, which would be put on the desk of Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump\u2019s designated secretary of state, on his first day in office.

Hedge funds cater to wealthy and sophisticated people who can afford to place big bets and to bear any resulting losses. That is very different from a food co-op on a tight budget, with retirees free to take their benefit as a single big check if they want. That option, though popular, has sometimes caused liquidity crises at other pension funds.\r\n\r\nMr. Holtz recalled that when the pension plan was established, in 1993, there had also been worries about the risks it might pose to the co-op. He said an actuary had set up a schedule of funding and benefit accruals that would make it safe and sustainable, as long as the co-op put in 1 percent of its sales every year. Projected annual growth, of both the co-op\u2019s sales and the pension fund\u2019s investments, would take care of the rest.\r\n\r\nPhoto\r\n\r\nSince then, a substantial body of academic work has appeared showing that such actuarial models are inherently biased in favor of risk: They call for investment portfolios to produce, say, 7 percent average annual gains over the long term, without adjusting for the fact that any such average will include both bear and bull markets. Such averages are deceptive, making it look as if valuable pensions can be provided by setting aside surprisingly small sums of money, then investing it aggressively \u2014 something that has brought pension funds to grief not just in Park Slope, but all across the United States.\r\n\r\nThe academic papers have won respect from specialists, but not much understanding by the public at large.\r\n\r\nIn Park Slope, however, gentrification turns out to have brought not only craft beers, man buns and deluxe baby buggies, but also a cohort of sophisticated finance professionals who still join the co-op for its cheap food.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\r\n\r\nOne of them, Jonathan Hessney, went to a recent general meeting armed with his own analysis of the pension investments.

11th day in office shrouded in crisis, roundly criticized for a chaotic unveiling of immigration measures and under new scrutiny after he fired the nation's top law enforcement officer who refused to enforce them.\r\n\r\nOn an extraordinary night of political drama Monday, the President dismissed acting attorney general Sally Yates by letter after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend Trump's immigration order, which bans travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations and temporarily halts refugee arrivals.\r\n\r\nYates was a remnant of the Obama administration, only in office until the Senate confirms Jeff Sessions as the next attorney general. But her dismissal reflected the sudden political forces unleashed in Washington in the early days of the Trump administration as the President seeks to impose his authority on the federal government and shows little patience for those who would block him from implementing core campaign pledges.\r\n\r\nDemocrats reacted with outrage to the night's dramatic events, warning that it called into question the independence of the Justice Department in the Trump administration.\r\n\r\nJUST WATCHED Yates in 2015: AG obligated to 'follow the law' Replay More Videos ...

John Conyers tweeted. \"If dedicated gov officials deem his directives to be unlawful & unconstitutional, he will simply fire them as if gov is a reality show.\"\r\n\r\nThe dramatic move came soon after CNN reported Yates told Justice Department lawyers not to make legal arguments defending Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees.\r\n\r\n\"(Yates) has betrayed the Department of Justice,\" the White House statement said.\r\n\r\nDeputy Attorney General Sally Yates was dismissed by President Donald Trump Monday evening\r\n\r\nDana Boente, who Trump appointed to succeed Yates as acting attorney general, rescinded Yates' guidance and instructed the Justice Department to \"defend the lawful orders of our president.\"\r\n\r\nYates was fired as the administration was still recovering from the fury surrounding Trump's hardline immigration measures, including stinging criticism from some congressional Republicans who said the administration's process was far from smooth.\r\n\r\n\"They know it could've been done in a better way and my guess is they're going to try to clean it up,\" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, told reporters. \"They probably learned that communication and the inter-agency process would probably be helpful.\"\r\n\r\nBut Trump's former GOP rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, jumped to the President's defense.\r\n\r\n\"After eight long years of a lawless Obama Department of Justice, it is fitting--and sad--that the very last act of the Obama DOJ is for the Acting AG to defy the newly elected President, refuse to enforce the law, and force the President to fire her,\" Cruz said in a statement.\r\n\r\nQuestions about White House functions\r\n\r\nTrump's immigration order has triggered one of the more significant moral and constitutional controversies in recent memory. But on a more fundamental level, it is raising basic questions about how Trump's White House will function.\r\n\r\nOn Monday evening, officials at the Department of Homeland Security were still spending hours in back-and-forth conversations with the White House.

MUST WATCH GOP on Defense after Trump's Actions 03:17\r\n\r\n\"These sort of amateur hour hijinks are costing President Trump precious political capital ahead of his aggressive legislative push,\" said Howard Schweitzer, a former high-ranking official in Republican and Democratic administrations. \"The PR debacle and failure to circulate this plan with leaders in Congress or our allies was a costly error and overwhelms any of the legitimate policies behind his order.\"\r\n\r\nTrump's rocky opening days come just as the administration needs to be at the top of its game ahead of Trump's announcement of his Supreme Court pick Tuesday night.\r\n\r\nTuesday's unveiling of a Supreme Court nominee will test whether he can win over crucial backing in Washington. In a polarized political atmosphere, a seamless introduction of a potential justice would strain even the most experienced West Wing, let alone a staff that has only been in place for less than two weeks and is already under fire.\r\n\r\nIf the administration clean up on the immigration order succeeds, there may be no lingering political price to be paid. But if the Supreme Court push staggers out of the gate, the Trump team could face an early political crisis on two fronts that will cast doubt on its capacity to enact its ambitious congressional agenda.\r\n\r\nAll new administrations have teething problems and it's not unusual for even experienced West Wing staffs to fumble badly. The disastrous debut of the Obamacare website in 2013 played into GOP claims that the law was botched by an incompetent administration.\r\n\r\nAnd there is no doubt that Trump is doing exactly what voters who rewarded him with 306 electoral votes sent him to Washington to do.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong sense in many parts of the country that the US government has been too lax in its vetting of Muslim visitors to the US out of a sense of political correctness. And while chaos reigned at the weekend, Trump's penchant for stirring confusion with his improvisational management style has often served him well as a businessman and in his short, successful political career.\r\n\r\nPresidential brand\r\n\r\nStill, one of the president's central claims to the White House is that he, and only he, can cut through what he portrays as dire problems facing Americans. So any hint of incompetence could damage his presidential brand and undercut his claims that his business tycoon personality can get things done.\r\n\r\nThe administration's defense of its actions Monday followed a now familiar tactic -- attacking the media for its coverage and fogging the facts with an alternative narrative.\r\n\r\n\"I think this has been blown way out of proportion and exaggerated,\" said White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday. \"I think frankly government functioned very well. That's the takeaway from this, that the system worked well, the country is safer for it.\"\r\n\r\nJUST WATCHED Entire White House remarks on immigration Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Entire White House remarks on immigration 58:02\r\n\r\nThe White House also made a case that the sudden change in policy was necessary to keep Americans safe from terrorism.\r\n\r\n\"We had 109 people that were temporarily detained. They were temporarily detained to make sure that the safety of the other 324 million Americans was put first. I don't see how that's a big problem,\" Spicer said.\r\n\r\nTrump, meanwhile, said in a tweet that it would have been foolhardy to have announced his policy in advance, as it would tipped off terrorists.\r\n\r\n\"If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad 'dudes' out there!\" Trump tweeted Monday.\r\n\r\nThough advancing a hardball national security argument, Spicer appeared to indicate on Monday there was no specific intelligence suggesting an attack was imminent from nationals of any of the seven listed nations.\r\n\r\n\"I think what we're trying to say is you don't know when the next threat is coming,\" Spicer said.\r\n\r\nTerrorism experts have pointed out, however, that none of the terror attacks on US soil since 9/11 emanated from any of the seven nations targeted by Trump.\r\n\r\nAdministrative confusion\r\n\r\nThe sense of administrative confusion in the government also undermines White House claims that everything went smoothly. Minutes before Trump signed the order in the Oval Office on Friday, his counsellor Kellyanne Conway told reporters that the immigration measure would not be issued that day. And in the hours after its release the White House struggled to explain exactly what it meant and which nations it would impact.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it seems instructions for how to enforce the new rules did not reach the officials on the front line \u2014 at America's airports \u2014 sparking delays and confusion.\r\n\r\n\"At the operator level, there was confusion and that needed to be flushed out and perhaps still needs to be flushed out,\" said James Norton, a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Department of Homeland Security during the Bush administration.\r\n\r\nAmerica's borders are policed by a diverse collection of officials from Customs, Immigration and Citizenship agencies and not all were clear what the new rules entailed.\r\n\r\nThat may explain uncertainty over whether green card holders were affected.\r\n\r\nUS allies were still puzzled Monday with the implications of the ruling. Britain said UK dual nationals would not be stopped from entering the US. Germany was not so sure.\r\n\r\nThere was also intense frustration on Capitol Hill, where GOP aides rejected the rationale that they were kept in the dark for national security reasons.\r\n\r\n\"If that's their approach going forward in terms of engaging the Hill on national security issues, then they're going to find out that the results are more than just a weekend of bad press,\" said one aide who asked not to speak for attribution.\r\n\r\nSpicer denied that the White House had left its congressional allies and government agencies in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody was kept in the loop at the level necessary to make sure that we rolled it out properly,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBut Schweitzer, who has piloted the Senate confirmation process of 20 presidential nominees, warned that if the White House did not up its managerial game, it would be offering an opening to its opponents.\r\n\r\n\"Trump's executive order was poorly written and implemented, and has generated so much negative press that it's reinforcing the Left's image of the Trump White House as xenophobic, incompetent hardliners,\" he said.", "fivelinesummary": "Trump's rocky opening days come just as the administration needs to be at the top of its game ahead of Trump's announcement of his Supreme Court pick Tuesday night.\r\nTrump tweeted Monday.\r\nThe sense of administrative confusion in the government also undermines White House claims that everything went smoothly.\r\nSpicer denied that the White House had left its congressional allies and government agencies in the dark.\r\nOn an extraordinary night of political drama Monday, the President dismissed acting attorney general Sally Yates by letter after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend Trump's immigration order, which bans travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations and temporarily halts refugee arrivals.", "tenlinesummary": "\"After eight long years of a lawless Obama Department of Justice, it is fitting--and sad--that the very last act of the Obama DOJ is for the Acting AG to defy the newly elected President, refuse to enforce the law, and force the President to fire her,\" Cruz said in a statement.\r\nOn Monday evening, officials at the Department of Homeland Security were still spending hours in back-and-forth conversations with the White House.\r\nTrump's rocky opening days come just as the administration needs to be at the top of its game ahead of Trump's announcement of his Supreme Court pick Tuesday night.\r\n\"If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week.\r\nTrump tweeted Monday.\r\nThough advancing a hardball national security argument, Spicer appeared to indicate on Monday there was no specific intelligence suggesting an attack was imminent from nationals of any of the seven listed nations.\r\nThe sense of administrative confusion in the government also undermines White House claims that everything went smoothly.\r\nSpicer denied that the White House had left its congressional allies and government agencies in the dark.\r\nOn an extraordinary night of political drama Monday, the President dismissed acting attorney general Sally Yates by letter after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend Trump's immigration order, which bans travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations and temporarily halts refugee arrivals.\r\nDemocrats reacted with outrage to the night's dramatic events, warning that it called into question the independence of the Justice Department in the Trump administration.", "sum_basic": "JUST WATCHED Yates in 2015: AG obligated to 'follow the law' Replay More Videos ...

Trump has shown during his brief time in office that he should have been, and should be, taken both seriously and literally -- by everyone.\r\n\r\nIn an unprecedented blitz of executive actions, the new administration continues to implement or set the traps for a raft of the campaign's most controversial pledges. A vague order delivered late Friday night, immediately and without notice to a number of federal agencies and hundreds of affected travelers , barred for 90 days the entry of \"immigrants and nonimmigrants\" from seven Muslim-majority nations into the US. The same order temporarily shutdown the US refugee program. Syrian refugees have been denied safe harbor indefinitely.\r\n\r\nTrump's executive actions capped off a dizzying week that saw congressional Republicans, dedicated for a generation to blocking new spending, promising to pay for the border wall , while the mostly Democratic mayors of sanctuary cities began to carve out a legal bulwark against the President's demand they be cut off from federal funding.\r\n\r\nWhether or not Trump's early actions will withstand a growing backlash that began on the streets and has spread to corporate boardrooms and into the offices of some elected leaders is an open question. But there are few signs he plans to defer to public opinion -- at least that of the public which opposed him from the outset.\r\n\r\nJUST WATCHED Protesters swarm airports nationwide Replay More Videos ...

Some of the initial flurry, like the travel and refugee bans, have arrived in the form of enforceable orders. They will face court challenges, but there are already worries the administration will ignore or sidestep judicial orders. His memo inviting the pipeline company TransCanada to \"promptly re-submit its application\" to jumpstart the Keystone XL project was, in effect, a very formal press release, but one that represented a clear statement of intent.\r\n\r\nBy midday Tuesday, when Trump's Keystone and Dakota Access pipeline memos were made public, the Native American tribe potentially affected by construction was considering its court options and the coalition of activists who camped out for months in the planned path of the DAPL were scheduling flights back to North Dakota .

When the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, canceled a planned meeting in Washington after publicly refusing to pay for a border wall, as Trump continues to insist he will, there was no subsequent threat to build it \"ten feet higher.\" Instead, the White House organized a phone call between the leaders.

This Senate confirmation process begins with partisan payback in the air.\r\n\r\nThat is on top of what was evident last February when Scalia died suddenly at a remote Texas hunting resort: The Supreme Court is deeply divided and every vote matters. A single justice among the nine can tip the balance on civil rights, criminal law and corporate regulation.\r\n\r\nRarely has there been a moment in American history of such widespread national discord, internal court divisions, and the opportunity for a new tie-breaking justice.\r\n\r\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny reported Tuesday that the two leading candidates are believed to be Neil Gorsuch , who sits on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, and Thomas Hardiman , who sits on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Pittsburgh. Both have met with Trump.\r\n\r\nThe jurist who eventually secures the lifetime post will likely decide the law not just for this generation but for the next.\r\n\r\nScalia, who died a month short of his 80th birthday, served for three decades, and given the relatively youthfulness of the finalists for tonight's announcement, a new justice could sit on the bench for 30 years as well.\r\n\r\nConstitutional confrontations\r\n\r\nThe nation's judiciary serves as a check on the legislative and executive branches. Not even two weeks as president, Trump has spurred a raft of controversy and litigation, particularly to his order last Friday temporarily barring refugees and certain other foreigners from entering the country.\r\n\r\nMost divisive is the part blocking entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries even if their visas were valid.\r\n\r\nOver his eight years as president, Barack Obama undertook numerous initiatives that were challenged in federal courts, including on immigration, health care and environmental regulation.\r\n\r\nBut none of his moves prompted such instant litigation and protest, which played out with demonstrations at the nation's airports and in public squares over the weekend. Lower court judges have temporarily suspended parts of the order.\r\n\r\nTrump, who has expressed pride in his disruptive ways, has asserted that the refugee restrictions would improve national security and protect the country from terrorists. Congressional leaders from both parties, along with immigration experts and legal analysts, have condemned the policy. Many say it is counterproductive to security interests and unlawful.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate arbiter of the constitutionality of Trump's sweeping new moves would be the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nA Polarized Court\r\n\r\nOn the current bench sit four Republican appointees who generally vote conservative (Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito) and four Democratic appointees who regularly vote liberal (Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan).\r\n\r\nScalia was a reliable right-wing vote, which made the court one of the most conservative in modern times. With Scalia, it curtailed the protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and other racial remedies for discrimination; allowed more prayer in public places; and restricted class-action lawsuits brought by aggrieved workers and consumers against big corporations.\r\n\r\nYet, because of Kennedy's centrist tendencies, conservatives were unable to roll back significantly abortion rights, as established by the 1973 Roe v.

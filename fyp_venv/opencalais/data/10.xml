The FTC said Qualcomm's use of low licensing fees was helping it to enforce its monopoly. \nIn response, Qualcomm said the FTC complaint was based on a \"flawed legal theory\" and \"significant misconceptions\" about the way the mobile industry worked. \nSoon after the FTC filed its complaint, Apple followed up with its own legal action seeking $1bn (£793m) in rebates and accusing Qualcomm of overcharging it for chips. \nQualcomm said it planned to fight both legal cases. \nThe chip-maker has been hit with legal challenges and regulatory action around the world over the last few years. \nIn December 2016, South Korean regulators fined it 1.03trn won (£698m) for breaking competition laws. \nIn 2015, it paid a $975m (£775m) fine in China following an anti-trust probe. The European Commission has also accused it of anti-competitive practices. \n</Body> \n</Document> \n--0b0aaf32369a4ec8b61a7ab47b9d2992-- \n",

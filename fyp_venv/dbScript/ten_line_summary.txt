"Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it," Trump said last summer when he accepted the GOP nomination in Cleveland.

Trump quickly came up against the judiciary when a federal court halted his controversial executive order banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries.

Despite GOP majorities in Congress, Trump isn't making much progress on his legislative agenda.

Democrats infuriated the President by clogging up confirmation of Cabinet nominees.

The only thing they can do is delay," Trump said during an extraordinary White House press conference last week.

Still, controversy can develop in unexpected directions in Washington and exhaust a White House staff in a way that can be detrimental to a presidency.

Trump is not the first President to come into power with a team that doesn't seem to quite measure up to Washington's demands.

"I was here through Carter, when a bunch of Georgians who thought they were the smartest guys in town arrived and they were going to fix everything."

But it seems unlikely that he meaningfully advanced his political agenda.

"All the so-called experts have been wrong consistently," Lacy said, adding that Trump had changed the way presidents are viewed along with the usual codes of behavior in the White House and Washington.

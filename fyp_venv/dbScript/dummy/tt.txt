Stephen Bannon Reassures Conservatives Uneasy About Trump
And he urged a ballroom full of activists to stick together against the forces that were trying to tear them apart.
Not too many years ago CPAC almost denied Mr. Trump a speaking slot because it feared he only wanted to promote himself.
As for Mr. Bannon, he was essentially banished from the premises when he was running Breitbart News.
So Mr. Bannon started a rival conference at a hotel down the street and called it The Uninvited.

Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, acknowledged the discomfort that comes with any hostile party takeover when she addressed the meeting.
Mr. Trump, she said, had to uproot the political system.
“Every great movement ends up being a little bit sclerotic and dusty after a time,” she said.
She predicted that CPAC would wholly embrace the new president.
“Well, I think by tomorrow this will be TPAC,” she said.
The destructive forces that Mr. Bannon and other conservatives complain about can sometimes come from within.
Mr. Trump’s first nominee for labor secretary withdrew after allegations of domestic abuse and revelations that he had employed an undocumented immigrant he did not pay taxes on.
His hastily carried out executive order barring refugees and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries has been tangled up in the courts and blocked from going into effect.
And questions of how closely members of his inner circle may have worked with the Russians to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s campaign continue to attract interest from investigators.
“Disruption is a good thing,” said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts CPAC.
Still, he acknowledged, “on some days they do it better than others.”

There is another lens through which to see the disorder that has characterized this White House, Mr. Trump and his supporters say.

“To try to remove me from the equation would remove one of his voices and one of his trusted aides.
They weren’t prepared for this result — even though they all ran around and said: ‘We’re a divided country!
We’re a divided country!’”

It was not as if the support for Mr. Trump, who will speak to the conference Friday morning, is not enthusiastic.
“Now does that mean Trump is going to stop being Trump?
No.”

These should be good times for conservatives — and much of the time they are.
They control not just the White House but both houses of Congress and appear on the verge of regaining a majority on the Supreme Court.
But part of the subtext of CPAC this year has been how conservative leaders are trying to smooth out the rougher edges of their movement, not all of which involve Mr. Trump.
Because of the association that a fringe element of Trump supporters has with white nationalists, the CPAC organizers held a panel discussion on Thursday to signal their strong disapproval.

Yet after the panel was over, the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer stood in the hall just off the main stage and declared himself a conservative.
Mr. Pence said the Trump victory has given conservatives “the most important time in the history of our movement.”

“My friends, this is our time,” he told the conference Thursday night.
“This is the time to prove again that our answers are the right answers for America.”

In his brief remarks, Mr. Bannon ended on a conciliatory note.
He insisted that conservatives all had more in common than most people realized.
But the core of what conservatives believe is “that we’re a nation with an economy, not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders — that we’re a nation with a culture and a reason for being.
“And I think that’s what’s going to unite this movement going forward.”

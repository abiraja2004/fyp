Conservative MP Simon Burns argued that the visit should go ahead -- whatever people think of Trump -- because of the close links between the US and the UK.

A rival 310,000-strong petition in support of the state visit was also being discussed.

The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, faced calls for his resignation from some MPs after he said he was "strongly opposed" to letting Trump address lawmakers during his visit because of Parliament's "opposition to racism and sexism."

Controversy over Trump's visit intensified after he imposed a travel ban -- later blocked by courts in the US -- on nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries.

Hundreds of people gathered outside the Houses of Parliament to protest the US President's visit, according to The Press Association.

According to the Guardian newspaper, options under consideration include inviting Trump in August when Parliament is in recess -- allowing the government to sidestep the controversy over whether the President should address lawmakers.

If Trump's trip was downgraded to an "official visit," the President would be deprived of a ride in the Queen's carriage, gun salutes, a banquet at Buckingham Palace and other ceremonial honors typically associated with full state visits.

No US President has received a state visit in his first year in office.

But Flynn -- who described Trump's intellectual capacity as "protozoan" -- argued that to grant the honor of a state visit to a president who had acted "like a petulant child" would send the message that Britain approved of his behavior and comments.

Labour MP David Lammy said it was to be expected that the US President would be invited to the UK, but that offering Trump a full state visit after only seven days in power was not acceptable.

He said that for the country to make such an invitation was to "abandon all its principles," and suggested that the move came because the government was desperate to make trade deals.

"We didn't do this for Kennedy, we didn't do this for Truman, we didn't do this for Reagan, but for this man ... we say, 'Please come and we will lay on everything, because we are so desperate for your company,'" he said.

Conservative MP Simon Burns argued that the visit should go ahead -- whatever people think of Trump -- because of the close links between the US and the UK.

A rival 310,000-strong petition in support of the state visit was also being discussed.

The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, faced calls for his resignation from some MPs after he said he was "strongly opposed" to letting Trump address lawmakers during his visit because of Parliament's "opposition to racism and sexism."

Bercow is one of three parliamentary officials who must approve any invitation for someone to speak in Westminster Hall, the venue typically used for grand occasions of state, where Monday's debate is being held.

Smaller protests in support of migrants were also due to take place around the country.

According to the Guardian newspaper, options under consideration include inviting Trump in August when Parliament is in recess -- allowing the government to sidestep the controversy over whether the President should address lawmakers.

If Trump's trip was downgraded to an "official visit," the President would be deprived of a ride in the Queen's carriage, gun salutes, a banquet at Buckingham Palace and other ceremonial honors typically associated with full state visits.

Labour MP David Lammy said it was to be expected that the US President would be invited to the UK, but that offering Trump a full state visit after only seven days in power was not acceptable.

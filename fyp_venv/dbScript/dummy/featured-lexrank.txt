﻿Insults fly as UK MPs debate Donald Trump's visit London (CNN) US President Donald Trump was accused of behaving "like a petulant child," during a debate in the British parliament about the controversial decision to invite him on a state visit to the UK so early in his term.

The comment arose as members of Parliament were discussing a petition calling for the trip to be downgraded because of Trump's "well-documented misogyny and vulgarity."

Labour MP David Lammy said it was to be expected that the US President would be invited to the UK, but that offering Trump a full state visit after only seven days in power was not acceptable.

This country is better than this.

Conservative MP Simon Burns argued that the visit should go ahead -- whatever people think of Trump -- because of the close links between the US and the UK.

A rival 310,000-strong petition in support of the state visit was also being discussed.

Scottish National Party MP Patrick Grady said noise from the demonstration could be heard inside the hall.

Smaller protests in support of migrants were also due to take place around the country.

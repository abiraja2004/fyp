﻿﻿State Department officials asked to leave by Trump administration Washington (CNN) Two senior administration officials said Thursday that the Trump administration told four top State Department management officials that their services were no longer needed as part of an effort to "clean house" at Foggy Bottom.

All four, career officers serving in positions appointed by the President, submitted letters of resignation per tradition at the beginning of a new administration.

The letters from the White House said that their resignations were accepted and they were thanked for their service.

The White House usually asks career officials in such positions to stay on for a few months until their successors are confirmed.

"Any implication that that these four people quit is wrong," one senior State Department official said.

"These people are loyal to the secretary, the President and to the State Department.

"This had been on course for over a year," another official said.

"He came out of retirement and promised to stay out (of) the administration.

Victoria Nuland, the State Department's assistant secretary for Europe, left on her own.

In her parting letter, Bond told her colleagues, "It has been an honor to serve with you as the Assistant Secretary for the past 17 months, and to have represented the United States as a Foreign Service officer for 40 years.

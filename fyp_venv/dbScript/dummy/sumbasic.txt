"I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens."

Trump quickly came up against the judiciary when a federal court halted his controversial executive order banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries.

Despite GOP majorities in Congress, Trump isn't making much progress on his legislative agenda.

Democrats infuriated the President by clogging up confirmation of Cabinet nominees.

The only thing they can do is delay," Trump said during an extraordinary White House press conference last week.

He's slated to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress later this month that will give him one of the strongest venues available to project presidential strength.

Trump is not the first President to come into power with a team that doesn't seem to quite measure up to Washington's demands.

"I think every administration goes through that," Trent Lott, a former Republican Senate Majority leader, said in an interview.

But it seems unlikely that he meaningfully advanced his political agenda.

Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, for instance, had rocky opening weeks as their campaign idealism encountered Washington reality.

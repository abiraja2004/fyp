﻿Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to UN, dies suddenly at 64 Story highlights Law enforcement official: Churkin died after suffering from cardiac arrest in New York

Former US ambassador: Churkin was "a formidable adversary, but always a friend"

He was known as a deeply intelligent, combative, disarming and humorous fixture at the UN Security Council.

He was taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where he died.

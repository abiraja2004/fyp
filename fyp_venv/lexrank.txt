Members of the UN General Assembly stood for a moment of silence in memory of their colleague.

"We've lost one of the most respected and influential members of the UN family," UN General Assembly President Peter Thomson said.

Thomson added: "Not only has Russia lost one of its truest sons, but here at the United Nations, we've lost one of our truest."

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, "Ambassador Churkin was a uniquely skilled diplomat, a powerful orator with great wit, and a man of many talents and interests."

Members of the Security Council said they were "deeply saddened" to learn of Churkin's death.

Churkin spent more than 40 years at the Russian Diplomatic Service and headed the Russian Mission to the United Nations for more than a decade, the Security Council said.

Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the United Nations, called Churkin "a gracious colleague."

"Devastated by passing of UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin," Power tweeted.

And Gérard Araud, a former French ambassador to the United Nations, said Churkin was an "extraordinary colleague" during Araud's five years on the Security Council.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said, "The outstanding Russian diplomat died while he was in his current working role."
